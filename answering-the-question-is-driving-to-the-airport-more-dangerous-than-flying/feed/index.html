		<description><![CDATA[Your conclusions are flawed.

&quot;Per mile, you are slightly more likely to die from flying than driving.&quot; 

There is no way that flying is more dangerous than driving on a per-mile basis.

From wikipedia, under &quot;Air Safety&quot;, it says that per billion kilometres travelled, there is on average 0.05 deaths. In a car, there is on average 3.1 deaths. For simplicity, if we assume that every plane crash results in 100% deaths, and there is only 1 person on every flight (both things are way-off the mark), there would -still- be 62 times more deaths travelling by car than by flying, on a per-mile basis!

Now consider, that source makes no differentiation between general aviation and commercial aviation.]]></description>
