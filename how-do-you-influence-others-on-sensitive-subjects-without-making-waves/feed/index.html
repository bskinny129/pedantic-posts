		<description><![CDATA[I think your euphemisms for your actions and beliefs can certainly be a way to avoid the judgements or assumptions that come with labels.  Why risk being incorrectly categorized before you have the chance to explain yourself?

However, the lack of labels doesn&#039;t seem to lead to more intelligent conversations, or any conversations at all.  I think you have a tendency to avoid opportunities to explain your beliefs (around your sometimes overly-passionate family members, at least).  But you underestimate how much we want to hear your views and your reasonings behind your choices.  You&#039;re a thoughtful, intelligent guy, and those who know you will respect your opinions on even the most sensitive subjects.  This blog is fantastic because we get to read what you&#039;re thinking but don&#039;t often say.

So whether you start with a label or not, throw your viewpoint out there more.  I am all for you expressing yourself more and risking some slight discomfort in order to encourage understanding.]]></description>
