		<description><![CDATA[Yes, learning statistics is lame. But using statistics to support an argument or draw crazy conclusions is awesome.

Thanks for the quote, did you make it up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Time for a chick comment!  I figure it&#039;s appropriate since you used &quot;chick math&quot; in your post  :)  Here&#039;s a quote I have framed that seems to fit your current mood:

â€˜It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.â€™

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re taking the necessary steps to get happy again.  Love you lil bro.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s quite a statement. I don&#039;t think I would be able to pinpoint a xkcd as my favorite - my recall of all the great ones over the years is very poor. But I remember them when I see them again!]]></description>
