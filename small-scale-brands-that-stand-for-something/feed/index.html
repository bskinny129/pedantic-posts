		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s an interesting thought. The American Cancer Society doesn&#039;t have the benefit of displaying their purpose directly on their product/packaging like a salt brand would. I&#039;m not sure how much advertizing Z gas stations are doing, but if they did none, I think the message would still make it out into the market as people are curious about the new brand.

You definitely bring up an excellent point about reinvesting in marketing - it makes sense to a point. Another example would be political donations - a certain percentage of your donation will go toward throwing more fundraising events to get more money! Good luck on the Chubbies decision, but I imagine it will be an ongoing conversation without a true answer - &quot;right now, what percent of our income should be put towards marketing?&quot; The answer will vary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re last point about the marketing budgets is the most interesting, as a righteous brand is only that way because people perceive it as such, which, in many cases, is do to marketing messages being pushed out to the public. 

One somewhat related tidbit is this: Wahl&#039;s dad was mentioning the American Cancer Society as an example that illustrates your point. They put so much money toward marketing to achieve the brand status and recognition they currently have. However, if you give money to them, &#062; 50 cents on every dollar goes to perpetuating the marketing machine. Seems Ponzi scheme-ish. Not sure if it&#039;s a necessary evil, though. Not sure of the correct balance of marketing to impact. 

We&#039;re having these conversations right now at Chubbies. 

Interesting problem and opportunity.]]></description>
