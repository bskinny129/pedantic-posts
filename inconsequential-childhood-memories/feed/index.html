		<description><![CDATA[In 4th grade I had a good friend, with whom I explored the 200 acres of woods and prairie surrounding her house. One time we found an old pig pen and decided we&#039;d clean it up and make it our fort. After spending hours cutting the grass with scissors, we figured we needed paint to snaz it up. Since we didn&#039;t have any money, we thought it would be a good idea to pick berries and make pigment out of that. Once we realized how many berries it would be, we completely forgot about the place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I have the worst autobiographical memory.  I don&#039;t know if I would want it to be as good as those people though...

4th grade memory - we learned how to use a checkbook.  I&#039;m sure kids don&#039;t even learn that anymore.

5th grade memory - once I forgot to do a homework assignment and Mrs. Lindvall gave me an incomplete (which I&#039;m sure wasn&#039;t going to be reflected in my grade).  But I felt really bad for forgetting and started to cry at recess.

So you think you were on a path to be cool until 5th grade?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[4th grade - A girl in my class did an exact copy of a frog I drew.  I reported this to the teacher (my favorite, Mrs. Sinclair) who told me that copying is a sign of flattery (she lost points as my favorite teacher that day).  I replied that I&#039;d rather not be given the compliment.

5th grade - Mrs. Bramsway read aloud &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot; with a tissue box next to her.  She also gave us &quot;The Deodorant Talk&quot; which basically was that she didn&#039;t want to smell any of us after recess.]]></description>
