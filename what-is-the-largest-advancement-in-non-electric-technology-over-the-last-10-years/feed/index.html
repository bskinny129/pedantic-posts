		<description><![CDATA[first, yes, hockey sticks have advanced extraordinary amounts in the last 10-20 years. in the early 90&#039;s it was all wood. then aluminum shafts with wood blades came about... soon there were carbon fiber shafts with wood blade inserts, but now most players (even at my level) use one-piece carbon fiber sticks with specific flex strengths/points and blade patterns. Thanks, China!

Gretzky was known for his vision more than anything, so not sure he would have been any significant amount better. probably some marginal % of shots that were a bit faster would have gone in... passes unlikely to be any different. however, you never know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had no idea the advancement in hockey sticks over the last ten year. One question for you, how good would Wayne Gretzky have been with today&#039;s hockey sticks?

I absolutely agree that hidden technology exists in many of these items. But out of sight, out of mind!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I was going to say hockey sticks... sooo... skinner&#039;s point is strong here.

what might be interesting is to note how much technology has ENABLED the non-tech advances. I&#039;d wager, a whole lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T-shirts are (can be) so much softer than they were back in the day.  Even more impressive I would say is dri-fit and other workout gear like that.  The whole moisture wicking thing is incredibly impressive.

Something I feel that should have gotten exponentially better but is still pretty much the same - deodorant.  How can they not make a deodorant that doesn&#039;t leave you wet and/or doesn&#039;t rub off on your shirt instantly.  Come on science.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, yes, yes, very much agree. I am a big advocate for the Vibrams - I&#039;m such a gimp I&#039;m convinced I can&#039;t run in real shoes anymore and expect to be pain free the next day. I&#039;ll let you know how the new Nike free running shoes are because I am about to make a purchase ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I totally am with you on the protein powder. It is much better than it used to be. I just started taking it again after a 10 year hiatus and man was I shocked!  

My submission has to be shoes. I don&#039;t know of you have tried the Vibram toe shoes or the Nike freerunners but the difference is immediately noticeable and much more ergonomically designed to work with our feet rather than against them (to say nothing about our knees and backs).]]></description>
