		<description><![CDATA[I really like the geek tangent idea.  I sometimes have some really dorky things I want to say that I think no one else wants to here.  If they don&#039;t, oh well, I warned them.

That&#039;s an interesting idea - you could take your parents DNA, compare it to yours, and analyze the likelihood that you received each trait the way you did!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First... Geek tangent totally rules and so does google.
Second... If they could do an analysis of you and your potential spouse (ie girlfriend) and give you estimates of how your kids would turn out, would you do that?  I probably wouldn&#039;t believe them even if I did do it because my kid is going to be so much faster than they would say.
Third... I wanna know why i can&#039;t grow facial hair and my dad has a mane.]]></description>
