		<description><![CDATA[Pretty sweet lil bro.

What really makes me smile is the fact that your brilliant, little brain was probably churning out a thousand interesting thoughts on that hike, but only the obvious, less-meaningful ones were expressed!  I love that your blog gives us a chance to read your thoughts that might not come up in conversation.  Similar to deleting those words from your vocabulary, this blog allows you to be honest and focus on what you value most.

Can I request that your conversational use of the word &quot;nay&quot; be increased to match your written use?  :)]]></description>
