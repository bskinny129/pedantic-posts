		<description><![CDATA[Great to hear from you again!  I just discussed this very subject with some friends this week.   The idea of these super-bugs without effective antibiotics is quite alarming.  I can see why you have made your choice to be a vegetarian.  Although the pesticides on plant life seems to be in the news quite a bit too.  We trust our government agencies and doctors will keep us informed, but as you pointed out, only after disaster strikes do we take action.  Thanks for the info.!]]></description>
