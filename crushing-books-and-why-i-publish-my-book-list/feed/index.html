		<description><![CDATA[goodreads.com helps with which part of the process? I&#039;m also not necessarily into easier - facebook is an easier way of communicating with you, but I def prefer this.

I agree with the value of fiction to an extent. I think my ideal would be to be reading a fiction physical book, non-fiction on my kindle, and biography (another non-fiction) audiobook. Also, Tim Ferriss just posted something quite similar: http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/02/24/the-top-10-fiction-books-for-non-fiction-addicts/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I finished Atlas Shrugged. It was awesome.

I was interested in the movie until I learned that they split it up into 3 parts - so the movie that came out is just the first third. And it flopped and got horrible reviews. There aren&#039;t exactly plenty of climaxes to make it acceptable to split into separate movies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should Preston!  I did a test month and I already love how it&#039;s going to turn out.  And it will be really fun to look back on my year... It was hard to adjust to remember to do it every day but I&#039;m sure it will become second nature after awhile.

Brian, have you finished Atlas Shrugged?  Let&#039;s watch the movie when you get back.  I&#039;m curious to see how they did it but I don&#039;t think it will do the book justice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Skinner you gotta do goodreads.com. It makes this process so much easier. Will you be my reading buddy?

I think there is a lot of knowledge and enjoyment to be gained from reading fiction as well as nonfiction. You&#039;re missing out if you confine yourself to real people and real facts all day long.

I also really like the 1 second video idea. I want to try though I would be shocked if I kept with it for any real length of time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the shoutout.  Though I can&#039;t believe, in all of our discussions, we didn&#039;t make it to the value of fiction for understanding the world. You need to get your Russian Lit on! That being said, my love of fiction is mainly theoretical. When push comes to shove, I&#039;m on to the next biology book.]]></description>
