I suppose something similar happens for guys, where they want to talk about their success with women. The difference is getting a compliment is not something worth bragging about ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the point about social validation and have used the following examples in making similar arguments to my friends:

Example 1:  The Christian Identification.
I was never big on &quot;outreach&quot; or the idea the idea that Christians need to &quot;save&quot; Non-Christians.  I don&#039;t believe that my position in any sort of afterlife is determined by the number of people I convert to my religion.  Instead, the message that hit home with me was to live your life in such a way that people could identify you as a Christian without you ever proclaiming it.  I think back to this message a lot when I hear someone referred to as &quot;very religious.&quot;  Of course an incredible spectrum of &quot;religious&quot; exists, but I greatly prefer the ones who actually live it to the ones who just advertise it.

Example 2:  The Girly Conversation (since Pedantic Posts is lacking in these!)
I&#039;ve noticed a pattern amongst the less secure girls I am friends with of announcing EVERY TIME a guy hits on them.  It&#039;s as if broadcasting any compliment from a guy somehow gives the girl more status or value in the eyes of her female peers.  More often than not, this behavior is exhibited by the girls who blossomed late and might still feel they have something to prove in terms of how desired they are by the opposite sex.  It all seems pretty odd and insecure to me.  Does the same occur amongst guys?]]></description>
