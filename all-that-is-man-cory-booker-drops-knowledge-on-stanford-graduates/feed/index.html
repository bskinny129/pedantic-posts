		<description><![CDATA[Exactly, what a baller! I am intrigued by his idea that cities are &quot;the last frontier to make real the promise of America&quot; - I guess he has proven the ability to turn around a city. But does that mean top down national policy won&#039;t work? He certainly operates on the belief that little things can make a big difference. 

He is the type of inspirational person people can believe in vs. a politician only capable of setting the right policy. In today&#039;s internet age, I think the inspiration factor is more important than just a decade ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cory Booker truly deserves a place among your list of manly men. Honestly, the work he has done to make Newark a livable city is incredible. Since he became mayor, the city has seen massive decreases in crime and drug-abuse. He also has this great theory about creating pride where you live by replacing all broken windows. His thought is that broken windows make people feel that they live in a dangerous place and lose pride in their community. If you keep the appearance of the area intact then you can actually build real community. Apparently it works.

Also, you mentioned the story of him rushing into a burning building, but this is a man who also shoveled the driveway of an elderly constituent when NJ got covered in snow a year or so ago. Such a badass.]]></description>
