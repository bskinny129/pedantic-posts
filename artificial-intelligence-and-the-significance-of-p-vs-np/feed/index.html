		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex, thanks for reading.

You are right of course, I oversimplified things here - P problems can be incredibly complex. One of my clients is a Stanford PhD level algorithms professor who told me that some theorists can come up with algorithms that are so complex they are simply impossible to implement.

Maybe I&#039;ll do a follow up post on the different approaches to finding solutions to NP problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this kind of stuff.  A few bits to add:

Polynomial time doesn&#039;t mean that the problem is not hard.  The traveling salesman problem is NP, but another similar sounding problem, which is to find the shortest route from A to B, is not NP, it is P.  However, the algorithm is a bit clever, so if you aren&#039;t clever then you will default to an NP searching algorithm.

Many times, just because you need to search through all the possibilities, does not make something NP.  For example, to find the smallest number in a set of number is P.

Finally, in real life many software either use approximations, or heuristics, or non-deterministic (some aspect of randomness) to generate good solutions to NP problems.  Or, if they need certain provability or guarantee, like that it will finish in a certain amount of time or come up with a solution of a certain quality, then they may change the definition to make it solvable by a P class algorithm they can analyze.]]></description>
