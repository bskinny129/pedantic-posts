		<description><![CDATA[Well I don&#039;t think it would replace colleges.  Of course there is still value in going off to college, making friends, growing up, and experiencing new things.  But I think we can save a lot of time and money by reexamining the whole process.

I have another idea for post-graduation studies (or really anyone) where you can gain some recognition for finishing those programs.  But this comment is not the place for it, so look forward to a post someday!

(I like the D/dt dropped in there (I&#039;m a fan of creative writing styles))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never thought about this from the perspective of replacing colleges.  I have thought about it in terms of post-bac/post-grad continued education programs--basically a virtual classroom for professionals.  Similar to Stanford Travel Study (in terms of clientele and marketing approach), with the shared goal of helping promote life-long learning.  Start it like facebook with the Ivy&#039;s Plus alum, then gradually expand.  I know Bill Gates has tried to establish a program that offers lectures online--and it costs a pretty penny.  

Anyway, how does this connect to getting a BA or BS, and testing?  Well, it doesn&#039;t directly.  However, I agree that the way we educate is not keeping pace with the D(we communicate and obtain information)/dt.  I think that during our lifetime, the landscape of how we learn is going to change in ways impossible to imagine from our current vantage point.  But I think that innovation, risks, and private industry definitely have a role to play.]]></description>
