		<description><![CDATA[I guess we start next week. I also like the idea of weekend challenges:
-who can eat the most by weight
-spend the most time standing
-spend the most time laying down
-walk the most miles
-talk to the most strangers

Or we could work on a skill for a set amount of time and have a winner take all contest:
-best juggler
-best hacky sacker
-best parkourer]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know I&#039;m so down for this.  Let&#039;s come up with week-long challenges that we do the first full week of every month or something.  I&#039;ve got a couple ideas to start with...
- Eat only one thing for the entire week (You get to pick what you eat, but whatever it is it&#039;s the only thing you are allowed to eat, plus water)
- Get as orange as possible in one week eating carrots (phenomenal idea)
- Don&#039;t sleep for a week
- Sleep for as many hours in a week as possible
- Spend as much time outside as possible
- Spend as much time inside as possible
- Don&#039;t shower for a week
- Live Amish for a week

Most of them aren&#039;t that exciting (or original), but give me a break.  When do we start?]]></description>
