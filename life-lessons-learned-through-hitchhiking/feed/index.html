		<description><![CDATA[The first time I hitch-hiked was truly an educational experience.  I was with a female (Erin May... wonderful girl) and it was both of our first times for such blatant disregard for common sense.  We made our way to the exit route for the city, some city in New Zealand that I can&#039;t remember, and keep in mind that there are only a handful of ways out of any given city.  Maybe 2, or 3.  All different directions.

Anyway - We were waiting and were terrified of who might pick us up.  After about 5 minutes of waiting... a small SUV pulled over and honked their horn.  We grabbed our bags and ran up in baited, albeit nervous, anticipation.  Two ~65 year-old women sat in the front seats and welcomed us aboard.  There was a period of 5 minutes of incredibly awkward semi-silence while we felt each other out and there it was from the driver &quot;So... well... umm... this is our first time and uh... you&#039;re not going to kill us or anything, are you?&quot;

We were both thinking the exact same thing!  From then on the ride was wonderful and we shared numerous stories.  They even took us to a couple places off the beaten path that there is no way we would have seen.  We never thought about hitch-hiking again and even picked up quite a few along the way when we had the resources... but that&#039;s another story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jimbo, getting on the conversation, I love it! I would rate the hitchhiking connections as better than the other various ways I have met strangers while traveling alone. However, this may be somewhat unique to New Zealand and maybe even just the south island of NZ, so take it with a grain of salt. 

Two immediate thoughts come to mind to support this belief. The first is the length of the conversation. When chatting with someone in the hostel or at a coffee shop they are usually short, 5-10 minute convos. As a result of the great distances covered by car while hitching, my rides last anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, resulting in much deeper conversations than the casual &quot;where you from, how long you traveling&quot;. My second thought is the forced nature of conversation at this time. On a bus, hike or anywhere else you are stuffed in with strangers, it is perfectly normal and expected to have long breaks without talking. As a hitchhiker you are expected to counteract the monotony of a long drive, providing a distraction or even entertainment for the others in the car.

You may be on to something with the trust/vulnerability observation. There is a certain comfort present when you are invited into someone&#039;s private space - the host is more open than they are in public. Thought experiment: which situation are you more likely to have a stronger connection. 1) Meeting a stranger on the sidewalk outside your house for a 5 minute conversation OR 2) Meeting the same person for a 5 minute conversation but taking them into your house and sitting on your couch. (Yes, asking someone inside you don&#039;t know would be weird, but this is a thought experiment, it doesn&#039;t have to be practical!)]]></description>
