		<description><![CDATA[I agree - Steve Jobs knows this principle like the back of his hand.  He gives just enough variety (all within the same product) so that you think &quot;which size ipod should I buy?&quot; rather than &quot;should I buy an ipod?&quot;.  You have just enough things to compare withing Apple&#039;s product line that you don&#039;t feel the need to compare other competitors products.

The whole Wal-Mart thing is very interesting as well.  Essentially they can decide which products survive and which ones don&#039;t by only selling products that are either selling for the cheapest or are an established brand. As a distributor should they be expected to treat all companies that want to sell in Wal-Mart the same way?  Or are they allowed to play favorites to maximize their profit?

There are similarities here to the late 19th century where the railroads were the way of distribution for products.  They had elaborate rebate setups to lower the shipping rate for the companies that shipped the most - makes sense.  BUT this meant smaller companies couldn&#039;t compete because they couldn&#039;t get the same deal with the railroads.  BAM, ruled illegal by the Sherman Act.  Is it the same for Wal-Mart, creating an environment where the little guys can&#039;t compete?  OR, is this off base because there are plenty of other distribute methods available today, namely the internet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve Jobs is the king of this. He took over Apple (for the second time) and saw a huge amount of options for computers, none of which were all that different. It was confusing. What did he do? Came out with the iMac. One option, maybe one or two sub-options at most. Then the iPod - one option. Then the iPhone - one option, max three (and it&#039;s clear which one is the primary option). 

Probably why I ended up getting an iphone to replace technodanceparty - I couldn&#039;t figure out which of the 1000 droid phones I wanted, but I knew the iPhone was an interesting option. 

By the way - wal mart and other retailers have already figured this out and have started pruning SKU&#039;s. Sucks for suppliers who don&#039;t get on the short list, great for those who do. but is this good for our society - increased commoditization and standardization? Hell of deep thoughts bro.]]></description>
