		<description><![CDATA[It would take a PhD is Statistics to figure that out! But maybe I can help a little?

The website howmanyofme.com tells me that there are 230,957 Erins in the US. That is 1 in 1330 people. The odds that a given Erin has your birthday is roughly 1 in 365. I don&#039;t know what state you are from, but if we assume all states have the same number of people, the odds this other Erin is from another state is 49 out of 50. So one in a half million people in the US will be named Erin, have your birthday, and be from out of state!

What are the odds that one of these people would work at the same plant and have automatic chemistry? I am stunned!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What are the odds that two people from different states, would end up working for the same company, end up in the same plant, share the same birthday, and share the same first name.  On top of all this, before we knew anything else, other than first name...Had automatic chemistry?  Is this a soulmate...Stumped and stunned?]]></description>

In this part of the hypothetical conversation I setup, the goal wasn&#039;t to stump you or make you do mental math - I want you to feel smart or at least involved in the conversation.]]></description>
