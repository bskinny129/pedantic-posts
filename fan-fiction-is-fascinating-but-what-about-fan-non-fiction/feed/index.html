		<description><![CDATA[I love Harry Potter. And it obviously has had the same affect on others with free time and talents. Lisa, you have free time, talent, and a love for Harry Potter. Why don&#039;t you make videos clips like those? What&#039;s it take to cross that boundary from fan to fan fiction creator? Maybe we&#039;ll never know ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Or what about when fan fiction takes a different form?  It&#039;s not written, but I think it qualifies as fan fiction.  And it&#039;s probably even more time-consuming to create than written ones.

Fanvids on YouTube!

It horrifies and intrigues me to think of the people that spend their time creating stuff like this.  Here&#039;s an example with Bones where the 2 characters actually have sexual tension:

But here&#039;s a great one that implies a romance between 2 characters where there isn&#039;t one:

And a more serious one that looks like it took a lot of work:

So good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once you have a device that can do everything, the next step is to do everything well. If you have to have a dedicated device to do it well, so be it. For example, many TVs come with built in speakers. And those speakers work just fine - you can hear whatever you are watching, which is the whole point. BUT some people want even better audio. Some people want the best possible experience. And if that means they have to buy huge speakers that sit next to their TV and smaller ones scattered around the room, they do it. That&#039;s my take on ebooks - ultra-convenient in digital form, but a repurposed device just won&#039;t quite cut it for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me it seems like a fad. Same as 3D TV. I just don&#039;t get it. Or rather I don&#039;t get ebook readers. Why have a device that only does one thing when you can have a computer or phone that does everything including store books for you? Still even while I think its silly I recognize that the whole world seems to disagree so I completely expect ebooks to continue to gain popularity and change/destroy the book printing industry as we know it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point - ebooks have a chance to revolutionize how books are published. I would love to see them try this out. How about on a smart phone with quick, 5-10 minute daily releases? Perfect for our short attention spans!

So I take it you don&#039;t buy into the whole ebook craze by calling it a fad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Count of Monte Cristo was originally published as a serial. I think I would really enjoy reading something that way. Perhaps this whole ebook fad will facilitate a return to this method of publication? I hope so. Otherwise I&#039;ll make myself wait a couple weeks between each chapter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great point: fan fiction can be, and often is, based on things other than books. But is it fan fiction if you try to get the script actually made into a TV episode? Many TV shows, especially the ones that don&#039;t have a following plot from one episode to the next (mostly comedies), have tons of different writers. Anyone can submit a script and if the right people like it, it just may become an episode. So does that start as fan fiction or are you not a fan if you try to sell it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t read any of it often enough.  but i get a kick out of &quot;fan non-fiction&quot; when i read it.  what i love most though is when people create fan fiction based on fictional tv shows or books--that&#039;s right.  for instance, one of my favorite tv shows, Bones, there are fan fiction writers  who create vignettes of the two main characters in a romance.  But the actual show is framed around the yet to be broken abounding sexual tension between the bones and booth.  so it&#039;s really the best of two completely fictional worlds. :)]]></description>
