		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I should always provide word counts for the things I link to - most of the readers here don&#039;t actually click on the links (that is a stat I can track).  That&#039;s one of the reasons why there are far less links in my recent posts.  It&#039;s also contrary to how I browse - when I read online I am constantly opening up tabs until Firefox can&#039;t take it anymore.

The google ad links are only marginally useful.  I rarely click on them, the last example I can think of was searching for parking by the San Jose airport - one company advertised a coupon for $7 a day parking.  I&#039;d imagine less tech savvy people click on the links more than you or I.  We have been trained to gloss right over them while others will slowly take in the whole page or start at the very top.

There are a ton of marketing people out there try to figure out your bang for the buck question.  Even just focusing online, there are soooo many different ways you can advertise, which one is the best?  Let me know what you find out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that really was a concise and clear explanation in Wired.  Good thing you told me it was only 200-something, wouldn&#039;t have read it otherwise.  
here&#039;s something i always wonder about though.  i never ACTUALLY click on the ads that pop up after a search or on my gmail.  and i imagine i&#039;m not unique (at least not in this situation).  so how do ad companies measure the efficacy of online advertising?  and what is the difference in terms of bang for your buck b/t super smart google algorithms and traditional media?  i&#039;ll investigate (one of these days).  :)]]></description>
