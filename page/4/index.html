<p>Most people avoid confrontation when possible. Makes sense, why get into a dispute if you don’t have to? But sometimes a little confrontation now can avoid a massive fight later on – by talking through things early, you can keep harmful thoughts from building up inside until they boil over. This is important in almost any relationship – business partnerships, love interests, foreign relations, etc. However, we don’t do it because it can be very uncomfortable. Some subjects are very sensitive: sexual orientation, religion, political beliefs, finances, the list goes on.</p>
<p>I’m generally very passive in this regard, just letting people believe what they want to believe – especially with religion and politics (but then again maybe this is just because I don’t have the burning passion about them that some people have). My thinking took a turn after reading the appendix of “Eating Animals”, in which the author explains the importance of vegetarians spreading the gospel to end factory farming and save the world. I learned that if you have the goal of making change in this world, you are going to need to recruit others on your side, even when the subject is sensitive or others don’t immediately care. </p>
<p>One individual can have a humongous influence with the ripple effect, where the new recruit turns around and recruits someone else. In the example of choosing not to eat meat, there are three meals a day where you influence others without getting up on a soapbox. But is that enough? To do more would require an uncomfortable conversation. I am willing to make the personal sacrifice of limited food options, but am I willing to put myself in awkward situations where I am apparently judging others’ beliefs?</p>
<p>Meatetarian or vegetarian is not even the most sensitive of subjects. What about other areas I might like to influence those around me? Especially those that don’t obviously and publicly occur three times a day. Even worse, during these conversations I would likely find strongly entrenched beliefs rather than the chosen indifference of meat-eaters. Good luck to anyone who wants to talk to my Grandfather about how the president is performing.</p>
<p>I recently watched a TED talk about the most sensitive topic of all, religion. It is ridiculous in this day and age that we can’t openly talk about religious beliefs when the other person isn’t the same religion. It’s even more ridiculous that such small differences in beliefs lead to wars. The first step to overcome this is to openly talk about religion and truly understand one another. Well, what better way to start this understanding than watching a video you are not likely to agree with? Here is Richard Dawkins advocating militant atheism.  <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/how-do-you-influence-others-on-sensitive-subjects-without-making-waves/#more-1696" class="more-link">Keep reading…</a></p>

<p>The web is an extraordinary place. Anyone that has had a conversation with me has probably received an earful about how awesome the internet is. One of the most incredible things about it is the diversity. Most people have their own little corner they know well and are completely unaware of the multitude of ways other people are using the internet. </p>
<p>Example: it might seem unbelievable, but some people search YouTube when they want to know something rather than Google. It depends upon your preference for consuming information – watching video or reading text. Or put another way, if you didn’t grow up using old school search engines, and instead have spent hundreds of hours watching videos on YouTube, where are you likely to go when you need information?</p>
<p>This isn’t your grandpa’s internet – the scale of YouTube is absurd. 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute, resulting in nearly 8 years of content uploaded every day. Over 3 billion videos are viewed a day, which is more than 1 video for each person in the world that has internet access. And it is only going to get bigger, growing at 40 or 50% since last year. Wow.</p>
<p>These kinds of numbers made me want to give creating YouTube videos a shot. So I did a little experiment – I made a couple videos answering simple questions:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cSB_b6tOM70" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
 <br><iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XMF_gcnjoH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I’m intrigued to find out if anyone actually watches these videos. Will they show up in Google search results on the first page? Will they even be the top result for a Google video search? How about a YouTube search? Will I like posting videos and make this a part of my internet life?<br>
 </p>
<hr>
 <br>
Yes, those searching YouTube for information are likely teenagers. The same ones that <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/14/nielsen-texting-stats/" target="_blank"><strong>AVERAGE</strong> 6 text per waking hour</a>. There is only a decade of age differential, yet I cannot even fathom this behavior.

<p>Coming off an emotionally rough Stanford loss last week to Oregon, pissing away the chance at a PAC-12 and national championship, Stanford football fans are <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/shell-shocked-ninja-turtle.jpg" title="tots shell shocked" target="_blank">shell-shocked like a ninja turtle</a>. But if there is one thing we know about ninja turtles, it is that they are resilient – they came from the gutter, became a force to be reckoned under the tutelage of Master Splinter, and bounce back after eating a little pizza. Do you see the parallels here to the Stanford football team, rising from an embarrassment to a national powerhouse under Master Harbaugh?</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to take a closer look at the Stanford and Cal football teams in recent years considering the 114th Big Game is this weekend. Even though Cal has taken home the Axe 7 of the last 9 meetings, this hardly tells the story. The Cal and Stanford programs have flip flopped in recent years – Stanford going from horrible to great, Cal going from great to mediocre.</p>
<p>Here is an interactive chart you can use to examine the last 6 seasons for the Stanford and Cal football teams. You can play around with it, but these settings are my favorite to show the trend: y-axis = Point Differential, x-axis = Win Percentage, Colors = Unique, Size = Wins, check all the boxes, and hit play (sadly Google doesn’t allow me to set the default values and it wasn’t worth the effort to explore other charting packages).</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js"> {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0Ars_ZhUIirTgdEQ4OHZwRE1mWWdXRkc5MHpWVWFVNWc&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A1%3AF13&gid=2&pub=1","options":{"showChartButtons":false,"vAxes":[{"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{}},{"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{}}],"height":371,"width":500,"showSidePanel":true,"hasLabelsColumn":true,"hAxis":{"maxAlternations":1}},"state":{},"chartType":"MotionChart","chartName":"Stanford and Cal 2006-2011"} </script></p>
<p>I’m no statistician, but it looks like Cal is trending nowhere and Stanford has the up and to the right trajectory that follows the group of overachievers everywhere in life. Tough break Cal, at least you’ll always have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZCCAqoSwY" target="_blank">The Play</a> to cheer you up. Go Card!</p>

<p>It has been almost a month since my last post – no I have not forgotten nor abandoned you. On the contrary, I have been spending my time becoming a more interesting person and broadening my perspective, which will only result in more interesting things to write about.</p>
<p>What have I been doing? As you may know, I left my job a few weeks ago to travel the world before the next step in my life. Traveling is important for building perspective – we all get caught up in our environment without realizing that there are other ways we can live our lives. This can manifest itself in many ways, but there are a couple specific examples I want to closely examine.</p>
<p>The first is what I call work-fun balance. The United States has a different relationship with work than any other place in the world. I don’t think I have to go into it here, but some countries have 35 hour work weeks and 8 weeks of vacation. They work to live and don’t put the same intense focus on their careers. The work-fun balance is particularly pronounced in my environment – having gone to an elite university, I am surrounded by friends that are on the hardcore side of US work schedules.</p>
<p>The second is how each of us approach money. Americans comparatively don’t travel as much and spend more money on possessions. There is a strong “keeping up with the Joneses” mentality that causes us to spend approximately what those around us spend. Running up a $100 bar tab, spending $50 on a meal, and popping into Vegas for the weekend – are these things I fully appreciate or just do because of my environment?</p>
<p>I don’t think my current perspective on these items is necessarily wrong – really there is no right or wrong. But I want to realize that there are other options available – in the end, not making a choice on these matters is effectively the same as a conscious decision. </p>
<p>What else should I focus on during my time on the road?</p>

<p>What do you with a baby you are ill-equipped to raise? Depends who you ask. Pro-life – you suck it up and raise the baby the best you can, even though it might be a disastrous situation with horrible consequences. Pro-choice – you likely nip it in the bud and try to not let it happen again. But why does pro-choice refer to abortion, isn’t there another option that we are forgetting? Whatever happened to adoption?</p>
<p><a href="http://pedanticposts.com/takeaways-from-my-time-with-the-bell-curve/" target="_blank">The Bell Curve</a> prodded my mind through statistics of American life. By slicing the data in various ways, the book examined the significance of inheritance and environment on intelligence and success of a child. As you may expect, both genes and upbringing factor in producing a kickass adult. One particular takeaway has been stuck in my brain – children adopted from a poor home environment to a better off home increase their likelihood of being successful.</p>
<p>This is particularly poignant as the world focuses on the life of Steve Jobs – an adopted child who turned out to change the world. What would the world be like if he wasn’t adopted and instead raised by his biological parents? What is the unreached potential of kids that are raised in ill-equipped households, without the option to escape to a better home?</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4803784090_4670323730.jpg" title="blue angels" class="alignnone" width="500" height="332"></p>
<p>Everyone has an opinion about how tax dollars should be spent. Without getting into politics, I want to take a stance on one way that tax dollars shouldn’t be spent: entertainment.</p>
<p>Today was <a href="http://www.fleetweek.us/" target="_blank">Fleet Week</a> in San Francisco – a free annual boat and air-show over the bay. It’s a first-rate two day performance featuring some of the best pilots in the world showing off their fancy moves, topped off with the world famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Angels" target="_blank">Blue Angels</a>. But one thing it certainly isn’t is cheap. The fuel expense of flying jets for hours should be immediately obvious to anyone that doesn’t drive a Chevy Volt. But then factor in the pay for the huge number of military personnel on hand, as well as local police and firemen, the total cost must be astronomical. </p>
<p>Why should everyone have to chip in their hard earned money to provide a good time for someone else? That doesn’t sound fair at all. But who says tax spending has to benefit everyone evenly? How about this question: why should everyone have to chip in hard earned money to provide sturdy roads that everyone doesn’t personally use? You could argue that roads benefit everyone, even to people that don’t drive themselves. But that misses the point – entertainment spending is fundamentally different than infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>The government should not control your entertainment spending! You should have the right to live in the United States and spend zero dollars on entertainment if you want. By using tax dollars to fund events like Fleet Week, you are paying for entertainment, but don’t have to attend if you don’t want. How unfair! </p>
<p>I’d imagine most the expense for Fleet Week is payed by the city of San Francisco from local taxes (with the belief that the event will attract tourists that will spend money). This is much better than using tax dollars from a citizen in Alaska to fund an air-show a thousand miles away. Nonetheless, not everyone in San Francisco necessarily wants the economic boost for the city nor the brief entertainment. Four days of loud airplanes overhead and two days of crowded streets aren’t graciously tolerated universally. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that not everyone appreciates the same type of entertainment. Fleet Week is one thing, but there are many more controversial events that our tax dollars fund. Think of how many events have police stationed for public safety. Do you think each one reimburses the city for the cost of providing police officers? Consider that events scale from providing <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/10/bachelor-ben-flajnik-san-francisco-street-snow-winter-wonderland-abc" target="_blank">two police officers to block off a few city blocks of snowy San Francisco for a television show</a>, all the way to providing <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/06/23/27417/michael-jackson-memorial-judge-tosses-taxpayer-law/" target="_blank">4000 officers in downtown LA for the death of a pop icon</a>. </p>
<p>Where do you draw the line? I say the line should be drawn at zero tax dollars contributing to entertainment!<br>
 </p>
<hr><p>I personally love Fleet Week and would chip in a few dollars for the entertainment. I think this is how it should be handled for entertainment events, all the way down to small-town Fourth of July parades. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve" target="_blank">The Bell Curve</a> is a controversial beast of a book that tickled my brain by examining a number of taboo subjects. Since collective intelligence is superior to mine, I’ll quote Wikipedia: “Its central argument is that intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and is a better predictor of many personal dynamics, including financial income, job performance, chance of unwanted pregnancy, and involvement in crime than are an individual’s parental socioeconomic status, or education level.”</p>
<p>The book also draws a number of insights into the class structure in America – the land of opportunity is no longer a meritocracy. A large percentage of the population doesn’t stand a chance. If trends don’t reverse, we are on a path to a welfare state with an enormous divide between the wealthy and poor (similar to many Latin American countries today).</p>
<p>A few bullet points for you to ponder:</p>
<ul><li>Our country has become extremely efficient at identifying intelligence and grouping the similarly minded together (without trying to). A hundred years ago there was a wide range of smarts on the assembly lines of factories. Today there is an extremely high correlation between IQ and income, largely due to our university system’s ability to identify the brightest and deliver credentials. This results in a self-perpetuating clumping of similarly intelligent individuals – every generation it will become more pronounced.</li>
<p> </p>
<li>20% of children in the United States are born to single mothers of below average intelligence. We know dual parent homes are better at raising kids and that brains are inherited (to some extent). Those kids head to the plate with two strikes already.</li>
<p> </p>
<li>Small shifts in the average IQ of the population have shockingly large effects on things like crime, unwanted pregnancy, divorce, unemployment, and welfare. As in a 2% shift of the bell curve in IQ yields a 15% difference in some of the aforementioned categories (causation not guaranteed, but with those kinds of numbers it must at least contribute). This is particularly important as it is estimated the average IQ is currently dropping by a point every generation. </li>
<p> </p>
<li>Education spending is heavily weighted towards the underprivileged (no child left behind), rather than gifted – 50 years ago this was not the case. If the goal of education is to help each child reach his or her full potential, this unbalanced allocation of resources is not ideal.</li>
<p> </p>
<li>It is a big no no to look at the average intelligence of individual races in America. Here are the numbers they quoted: African Americans 85, Latino 89, White 103, Asian 106, and Jews 113 (if you are a Jew does that mean you aren’t counted in the other categories?). Considering the exodus of the best and brightest from inner cities, the average IQ of those left behind is shockingly low.</li>
</ul><p> <br>
Pretty interesting stuff, what do you think? Are these things you have thought about before?<br>

<p style="font-size: 12pt;">You are very attractive, but I am not attracted to you. That cigarette in your hand ruined it for me.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s not about the smell, I can get over that. It’s not even about the reflection upon your intelligence, although it certainly doesn’t help.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s about the future. How are we going to build a better tomorrow when you are so short sighted?</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s about inspiration. How are you going to inspire me to be a better man when you settle for blatant imperfections?</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s about respect. How am I supposed to respect you when you don’t even respect yourself?</p>

<p>Lately something has been bothering me – why are smart people so dumb? What is it with the focus on careers, working 60, 70, 80 hour weeks for money they don’t need? Don’t they realize money is worthless without the time to spend it? Don’t they realize the opportunity cost? Life is passing them by, yet it is often enjoyed by dumber people with less money!</p>
<p>If they are so smart, they should simply figure out what will make them happy and their life a success. Instead, the smartest of the smart receive an elite education and quickly get funneled into jobs with vague titles like “consultant”, “investor”, or “capitalist”. They receive promotions, make buttloads of money, and surround themselves with luxuries. These people fall into two categories: those that justify their behavior and those that don’t think about it.</p>
<h1>Justify</h1>
<p>Some people are happy working 80 hours a week and truly believe it is what they want. To them I say – show me just one person on his death bed that wishes he had spent more time in the office. Even those who did very meaningful work, helping others, providing for a family, realize just how valuable that time is when it is gone. There is more to life.</p>
<p>Some people try to front load their careers, thinking, if I can just last in this job until I’m 35, I’ll have enough money to be set for life. That is a slippery slope and quite a sacrifice. If you don’t walk away when you are on the bottom, what makes you think you’ll walk away when you are on top, making even more per year? After sacrificing your youth and damaging countless relationships, how enjoyable will your retirement be?</p>
<p>Even worse is the feeling of entitlement – “I have worked hard my entire life and I’m incredibly smart. I deserve to make $150k, drive a BMW, and be the envy of my neighbors.” Ew. You are not entitled to anything, I’m sure there are others that work just as hard at the bottom of the totem pole. Quit justifying your lavish behavior and start appreciating the fact that the best things in life are free. </p>
<h1>Don’t Think</h1>
<p>I believe most smart people don’t think about happiness and the definition of a successful life. They just put their head down and devote the majority of their time to kicking ass at their job – have they even thought about what is at the end of that road? Is it really what they want?</p>
<p>These are important questions, but they are rarely even considered. Why does this happen? The people that go to elite universities are overachievers. They grew up smarter than their peers and likely dominated in a number of other areas. For whatever reason, they love to win, and their career is the most obvious way to dominate in adult life.</p>
<blockquote><p>When people who have a high need for achievement … have an extra half hour of time or an extra ounce of energy, theyâ&#128;&#153;ll unconsciously allocate it to activities that yield the most tangible accomplishments. And our careers provide the most concrete evidence that weâ&#128;&#153;re moving forward. You ship a product, finish a design, complete a presentation, close a sale, teach a class, publish a paper, get paid, get promoted. In contrast, investing time and energy in your relationship with your spouse and children typically doesnâ&#128;&#153;t offer that same immediate sense of achievement. Kids misbehave every day. Itâ&#128;&#153;s really not until 20 years down the road that you can put your hands on your hips and say, â&#128;&#156;I raised a good son or a good daughter.â&#128;&#157; You can neglect your relationship with your spouse, and on a day-to-day basis, it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t seem as if things are deteriorating. People who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to underinvest in their families and overinvest in their careersâ&#128;&#148;even though intimate and loving relationships with their families are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>                      Harvard Business Review – <a href="http://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life/ar/1" target="_blank">How Will You Measure Your Life</a></p>
<p>The tradeoffs are very subtle. Bob Barker is not going to present you with two Showcase Showdowns and ask which one you want. It’s a gradual process built up by hundreds of daily micro-decisions stacked up over years. In fact, no individual decision is even multiple choice. Smart people prove to be just as capable at ignoring the innumerable options as dumb people.</p>
<h1>Social Pressures</h1>
<p>If only it were as easy as identifying all the possible choices and making the correct decision – there are external pressures in play as well. Many smart people spend the first quarter of their life in school, showing exactly how awesome they are. An elite education provides the opportunity for a wonderful career, something largely beyond the grasp of the general populace. In fact, not only do you have this opportunity, it is expected of you to capitalize on it. The majority of your drinking buddies from school move on to big things in the working world, providing a comparison pressure. You don’t want to let down the family that sacrificed to give you the opportunity. Many high school friends, and all those less fortunate, would kill to be in your position, how can you throw that away? It’s a good thing most of them will never have to grapple with these questions!</p>
<h1>A Less Fulfilling Life</h1>
<p>These forces add up and result in a less than fulfilling life for many of the smartest people in our great country. It is a shame. They take the sure thing (career), misallocate their time, and don’t consider the other options. But I don’t blame them. If you knew you can make over $100k per year just by putting in the time, had everything your heart could desire, and were the envy of those around you, would you turn that down on the off chance that you could look back on your life and deem it time well spent? </p>

<h1>Happiness</h1>
<p>I have been in a rut recently. Don’t worry, nothing to worry about too much, just not as happy-go-lucky as I am normally. Despite some great times and surrounding myself with wonderful people, I’ve been returning to a baseline that is simply not where it should be. My plan is to purposefully over-correct – check back for updates in this area.</p>
<h1>Blogging</h1>
<p>You may have noticed I have been blogging less recently. This isn’t a conscious effort or because I have been abnormally <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/the-day-i-lost-two-words-from-my-vocabulary/" target="_blank">busy</a>, rather it appears to be a lack of inspiration. Less crazy ideas are popping into my head, and the ones that are aren’t being acted upon. Heck, even the few posts that I have started sit unfinished.</p>
<h1>Idiots</h1>
<p>Less blogging and less happiness? Sounds like blogging leads to happiness. Or if not, happiness causes people to blog. Wrong, that’s what idiots would say. Data geeks will quickly let you know that correlation does not imply causation. What do you think, is there any causation here? Does it flow both ways, and if so, are there limits or will it just continue to snowball until I’m spending every minute blogging and loving it?</p>

Along with the over-correction in happiness, I’d also like to over-correct in  my return to blogging. Just hang tight!
