		<description><![CDATA[That is a tough question to answer straight up, so I will not. 

If weird, you will quickly be able to decide whether you find it interesting, which will end the conversation or make it enthralling. Win win (because ending it beats the alternative, small-talk).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More like if you care enough to take the time to write a post on a specific topic, I respect you and care enough to leave a meaningful comment that actually answers your question or contributes to the discussion.

I disagreed with Pops for wasting an opportunity to actually share and connect.

Sorry!  &#060;---- Where is that damn sarcastext when you need it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most encounters you have a short window to decide whether that person is exciting. The default outcome is that both people go their separate ways and you may run into them again some day.

With small talk, you are going to have the offer accepted and then both head your separate ways. With the less conventional approach of superlatives, you may not have a high success rate, but you will likely make some lasting connections.

So what is your goal - not to look weird or to find people you would get along with?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha that is great feedback! My response is that they should pay attention to social clues. They might be soooo passionate that they could talk to a wall, but they aren&#039;t talking to a wall. They should notice your reaction and be willing to quickly switch to talking about something else that you might find interesting - but still something they are equally excited about that isn&#039;t small talk!]]></description>
