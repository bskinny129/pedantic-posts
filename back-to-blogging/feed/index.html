		<description><![CDATA[I loved all your pictures of Thailand -looks like you had a blast! I&#039;m definitely trying to make it up there, but don&#039;t really want to do that trip alone. Help me convince Tom to meet me there in February.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am excited to meet some fun people in New Zealand. From what everyone says, there aren&#039;t many people, but plenty of travelers making their way around the island, just having a good time. Crazy stories coming soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deep thoughts from a well experienced traveler. It&#039;s been an interesting transition these last couple of weeks, trying to become comfortable with just spending time. Of course I&#039;m still doing some things, but no massive projects I&#039;m cranking away on (by design to take a step back from it all).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just go to Thailand. It will blow your fucking mind. 

It&#039;s also interesting to look at education and resulting career opportunity in foreign countries. You see a mix of values, methods, and results. For me, it enforced not taking things for granted. 

Have fun with all the Aussies and Israelis - its amazing what percentage of travelers all over the world come from those two relatively small populations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you&#039;re back!

To provide balance to what Eric said... don&#039;t forget to focus on relationships as well.  You&#039;ll meet and interact with a ridiculous amount of unique people, but only if you throw yourself out there.  I wanna hear some crazy stories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How to be comfortable being alone. not that you have a problem with it, just that solo travel takes it to another level. You spend time with your own thoughts and get comfortable just spending time. Realizing that ultimately, you are all you have, and if you&#039;re lucky, family and friends, and that&#039;s OK. You may come to believe (I did) that time does not &quot;fly by&quot; but making yourself busy just disguises how much time is passing.]]></description>
