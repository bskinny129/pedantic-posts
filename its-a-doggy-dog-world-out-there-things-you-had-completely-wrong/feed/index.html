		<description><![CDATA[Literally, to play something by ear is to play it as you hear it. So figuratively, it means to do something as you go along. What doesn&#039;t make sense in that?

The amount of stupidity in the post and the other comments is amazing.]]></description>

It&#039;s sad but true - my family will never let me live down the moment I asked to verify that we were standing in the Atlantic Ocean.  So what if we were in Atlantic City at the time? . . . ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My sister and I both thought it was &#039;play it by year&#039; until just a few years ago.  I still maintain that it makes more sense then play it by ear.  
Example:  
What are you doing tonight?  
Let&#039;s go to the movies and then we&#039;ll play it by (y)ear.
Translation 1: Let&#039;s go to the movies and then we&#039;ll wait around for a while.
Translation 2: Let&#039;s go to the movies and then we&#039;ll listen  to some sound and try and imitate it that way.

Which makes more sense!?]]></description>
