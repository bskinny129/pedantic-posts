				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pedanticposts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2741404653_cb3f31386a_z.jpg" alt="2741404653_cb3f31386a_z" width="500" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2072" /></p>
<p>Humans are fallible: we don&#8217;t always act rationally. This isn&#8217;t exactly an enlightening statement. But we don&#8217;t usually extend this thinking to ourselves to realize when we are committing errors in reasoning. Nor do we take the time to examine where the mistakes in reasoning were made by others, rather we just conclude they are stupid.</p>
<p>This can range from huge self-identity beliefs like not believing in global warming. Or small things that might be irrational like paying for someone to wash your car, but not to clean your house. </p>
<p>It would be well worth our effort to improve our understanding of what underlies these errors of reasoning. We would make less mistakes ourselves, have more empathy for people with differing views, and have insight into their underlying beliefs that could potentially be used to persuade them.</p>
<p>I believe a limited cognitive reasoning vocabulary might be holding us back. Most cognitive biases make sense when you hear them explained. For example, &#8220;Bulverism – dismissing a claim on the basis of how the opponent got there, rather than a reasoned rebuttal&#8221; (<a href="http://mcntyr.com/52-concepts-cognitive-toolkit/" target="_blank">source</a>). The concept itself isn&#8217;t advanced, you get it. But if you don&#8217;t have a word or short phrase for that concept, it will hurt your ability to quickly identify it. </p>
<h3>Somewhat Made Up Analogy Time</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s rewind a few thousand years to a time when our number system wasn&#8217;t yet invented. Before base 10 with independent digits in each place (1s place, 10s place, 100s place, etc.) with the <a href="http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/who-invented-the-zero" target="_blank">concept of zero</a>. Hard to fathom, but it really existed.</p>
<p>The number system largely relied on counting and they probably had a word for each individual number, not just digits. Since people have 20 fingers and toes, I would bet every language had a different word to count at least up to 20 (but 7 and 17 weren&#8217;t related words). And they probably didn&#8217;t really have much need for anything beyond that for a long time. Eventually things became more sophisticated, with an actual monetary system and even some division of labor beyond small tribes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they could understand large numbers just fine, but without much precision. Perhaps they had a way of estimating large numbers &#8211; each sheep is represented by a grain of rice, with my sheep numbering a fistful of rice. Imagine needing to do that inaccurate translation in your mind every time you encountered a number beyond 20. Would it slow you down? Would it be less accurate? </p>
<p>Armed with a new conceptual framework and vocabulary, you can improve your understanding. If someone says they have 450 sheep, I know exactly how much that is. Instantly and accurately. </p>
<h3>Tying it Back to Cognitive Reasoning</h3>
<p>If you have definitions in place for the various errors in reasoning, it will take less effort to identify when they happen, you will be more accurate, and have more success explaining it to others. Skeptics will be able to explain why they disagree. Gullibles will have some tools to realize when they are being led astray. </p>
<p>Even though we aren&#8217;t taught this, it is well worth our time to learn it on our own. Here are a couple links I am starting with:</p>

<p>The passengers in the back seat were nodding off. 2 hours into our drive to Tahoe, the excitement had worn off and the sleepiness of a late Friday evening had set in. I was in the front seat with my mind still running, unable or unwilling to doze off. Then the bomb dropped.</p>
<blockquote><p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be vegan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Brian Skinner</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the scene 7 years ago when I first admitted to my closest friends I was getting out of the meat game. It awoke the whole car instantly. Shock slowly gave way to confusion, which led to the first of my many forthcoming discussions about meat.</p>
<p>2 months as a vegan, 7 years as a vegetarian, and now it is officially over. Before getting into my decision to give it up, why did I start in the first place? There are so many factors: environmental, personal health, disgusting factory farming, antibiotics, the list goes on. Any one of these should be reason enough, but in combination it should be overwhelmingly obvious.</p>
<p>However, one powerful reason is more effective than 3 powerful reasons and 5 pretty good reasons &#8211; if all the top reasons are equal, pick one that is most equal to focus on. For me this is the long-term personal health benefits by avoiding the daily poison that is the factory farmed meat America consumes.</p>
<p>I am proud to have bucked the norm and consciously developed a habit that provides lasting benefits to myself and the world. But 7 years is a long time, maybe it is time to examine the results and see if there are ways to improve.</p>
<p>The first 5 years of being a vegetarian I was incredibly healthy. More energy, less fat, just 2 common colds the whole time. The last 2 years have been disappointing on this front. Random minor health issues including semi-frequent colds. Weight creeping up 4 pounds a year. Less energy despite plenty of sleep, less stress, more exercise, and happiness at an all time high.</p>
<p>This might be normal for Americans, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to accept it in my life. Instead, what changes can be made?</p>
<p>I concede that some meat is healthy. The health benefits of being a vegetarian come from avoiding the 99% of US meat that is factory farmed. But it is extremely hard to make the decision every meal &#8220;is this healthy enough?&#8221; I don&#8217;t have infinite willpower. Without going 100% vegetarian I would surely find myself in situations where I would backslide into poor decisions. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t another vegetarian meal on this whole airplane, guess I don&#8217;t have a choice and will have to go with the chicken meal&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Chipotle advertises that their meat is naturally raised, it is probably good enough&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;well I&#8217;m hungry and this place only doesn&#8217;t have anything vegetarian on the menu&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead I set rule to avoid all meat. Until now. The new rule is vegetarian out in the chaotic world and carnivore at home where I have 100% control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="margin-left:68px" src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hazmat.jpg" alt="hazmat" width="328" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1971" /></p>
<p>The world has some big problems. We have shown we aren&#8217;t very adept at scrambling to deal with crises once we&#8217;ve reached the point of no return (see global warming), so maybe we should get a head start on the next disaster?</p>
<p>I recently read an interview of a doctor that says <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/health-science-technology/hunting-the-nightmare-bacteria/dr-arjun-srinivasan-weve-reached-the-end-of-antibiotics-period/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve reached the end of antibiotics</a>. There are bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics known to man. This is bad. </p>
<p>Every time bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic, there is the chance that it will become resistant to it. When you have another antibiotic to try (there are thousands), this isn&#8217;t horrible, just try the next one. But we&#8217;ve now reached the end of the line where some &#8220;super-bugs&#8221; have shown resistance to every antibiotic humans have discovered.</p>
<p>The reason I got to thinking about this is the NFL&#8217;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers locker room was <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1818678-falcons-reportedly-disinfected-locker-room-after-buccaneers-departed" target="_blank">cleaned by a hazmat crew</a> after their game this week. Why? Several of their players have had MRSA, which is a highly resistant bacteria, and they don&#8217;t want it spreading to anyone else.</p>
<p>Typically this antibiotics problem is limited to hospitals. Someone gets a nasty wound and bacteria climbs on in. In the last 50 years with antibiotics, people rarely die from this. We could simply kill the bacteria with antibiotics. This opened up a world of new possibilities, everything from organ transplants, chemotherapy, and more. Basically any treatment that weakens your immune system is less of a concern when have antibiotics to treat infections. </p>
<p>Now we are seeing bacteria resistant to all antibiotics known to man. We are also seeing these nasty bacteria away from hospitals. (Apparently these bacteria are football fans just like the rest of us. They probably have a fantasy team that benefited by keeping a few Buccaneers players out of games.) But we are still in the early stages, no need to get all worked up yet. But what happens when there are more-and-more super-bugs out there? What happens when going to the hospital is too dangerous? Should we start thinking about this now?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s turn to solving the problem. First, we need to slow down the creation of these super-bacteria by using less antibiotics. In the meantime, we also need to create some new antibiotics we can use.</p>
<h3>Creating new antibiotics</h3>
<p>According to the interview linked above, the low hanging fruits have been discovered. It has become more difficult and expensive to discover new antibiotics. It doesn&#8217;t make sense financially for the drug companies to spend time working on this. Antibiotics sales bring in a pittance and there is too much money to be made by continuously selling you a drug that lowers your blood pressure. We need to fix these incentives or ramp up government funded efforts.</p>
<h3>Using less antibiotics</h3>
<p>We need to seriously cut back on antibiotic use. Less preventative use as well as saving certain strains for our last resort. I don&#8217;t know much about how they are used in humans, but the obvious place to cut back is for factory farmed animals. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/opinion/antibiotics-and-the-meat-we-eat.html?_r=0" target="_blank">30 millions pounds of antibiotics are used on US animals each year, compared to 8 million pounds for humans</a>. Supply and demand at its worst &#8211; with so many carnivores demanding meat, this is one of the consequences. Here&#8217;s a short excerpt from the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I’d like to ask you about the use of antibiotics for farm animals. I know a large share of the antibiotics produced in this country is used in agriculture. Do you see problems there? Is that generating resistance as well as the use for humans?</strong></p>
<p>We know that the use of antibiotics in any setting, and especially the overuse of antibiotics in any setting, is an issue that will generate resistance, that will lead to problems of resistance. That applies as much for human use as it does for animal use.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that if they’re used for animals, there’s actually a pathway to resistance that is a threat to human health?</strong></p>
<p>I think there is. There have been a number of studies that show that when you give antibiotics to animals, especially to animals that we then eat, there are antibiotics that get into their systems that can develop resistance, and then when we eat the food, we can be exposed to those resistant organisms.</p>
<p>We also know that if antibiotics are used in animal feed that they can end up in animal waste, so we can end up with antibiotics in our water supplies, and it’s that type of low-level presence of antibiotics that can also lead to issues with resistance. </p>
<p><strong>Do you think we have enough data to know what’s happening with the antibiotics used on the farm?</strong></p>
<p>I think we know enough to say that we need to be doing a better job of improving appropriate use of antibiotics in all sectors, humans and animals.</p>
<p>But the agriculture sector is different, because antibiotics have been used there for a long time with an eye toward improving the growth of the animals, really for food purposes, to make them bigger and fatter with less food. Does that concern you as a use?</p>
<p>Certainly the CDC believes quite firmly, and I think there are a number of veterinary experts here and in other places who agree with the stance that we should never be using antibiotics in agriculture or in people for any other purpose than to treat infections.</p>
<p>Using antibiotics to promote growth in animals is not a good use of antibiotics. It’s not careful use of this really delicate and invaluable resource.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/02/21/147190101/how-using-antibiotics-in-animal-feed-creates-superbugs" target="_blank">How Using Antibiotics In Animal Feed Creates Superbugs</a> for some more deets. </p>
<hr>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how I tie everything back to &#8220;you should be a vegetarian&#8221;. It reminds me of the standup Jerry Seinfeld does in The Shower Head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family&#8217;s nuts; they&#8217;re crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, I had lunch with him the other day, he&#8217;s one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti&#8217;s not al dente? Cook&#8217;s an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn&#8217;t get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully mine&#8217;s not quite as irrational &#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_1837-e1353482839136.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_1837" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1942" /></p>
<p>I like to occasionally examine my comfort in life in different areas, especially socially and professionally. And it&#8217;s not because I want to make sure I&#8217;m nice and comfy &#8211; quite the opposite. If I&#8217;m not pushing my comfort zone in these areas then I&#8217;m not growing. If I&#8217;m not growing then I&#8217;m content with mediocrity. If I&#8217;m content with mediocrity then I&#8217;m letting time pass and simply waiting out my days left on this planet.</p>
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>New Zealand is full of some serious hiking and with serious hikes come seriously long conversations. On day 4 of 5 at Abel Tasman Tom, Jess, and I were ranking our favorite years at Stanford. This was very hard considering we had more fun than is legal. Seriously, some of the stuff was illegal. By examining my 4 years, there was one that comparatively stood out as the worst &#8211; my sophomore year. The year before I had established my friends and gotten to know my team and fraternity. And then I comparatively coasted socially through sophomore year, not branching out as much, sticking more to my comfort zone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the most outgoing person in the world, but I&#8217;ve come to realize that it makes me happy to make new friends. Even though I love my current friends and it might be uncomfortable, I know that I am much happier when I push my comfort zone socially. </p>
<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>Professionally it is also extremely important to constantly learn new things and take risks. If you&#8217;re not innovating then someone else is. If you&#8217;re not learning new skills and making yourself replaceable in your current role, someone else will. There&#8217;s no such thing as staying in the same place. If you&#8217;re not advancing those around you are, meaning you&#8217;re going backwards.</p>
<p>Two years ago in NYC I shared a cab with a guy from the hotel all the way out to the airport. In rush hour. It took almost 2 hours to get there so I got to know the guy pretty well (and unfortunately can no longer claim I&#8217;ve never missed a flight). His career advice: get fired at least once. This wasn&#8217;t coming from a slacker &#8211; dude knew what&#8217;s up. His reasoning: you have to pursue your ideas with gusto in order to make it to the top. You might get fired for having ideas that clash with management or taking too big of risks. So be it. There will be another company that will value the mistakes of action of a young go-getter.</p>
<p>I suppose the guy in the cab took this principle to the extreme. Taking risks is good, pushing the comfort zone is great. But let&#8217;s not get too crazy about it! The best way I&#8217;ve found to look at it &#8211; how comfortable am I? Am I being challenged?</p>
<hr>
<p>Other areas this applies: physically, financially. More?</p>

<p>What a year it has been! It&#8217;s been all about challenging assumptions, shifting paradigms, and setting up the life I want. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few areas.</p>
<h1>Vacations</h1>
<p>I spent my first significant time out of the country. And loved it. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll be satisfied with 1 or 2 week vacations ever again. </p>
<p>Tim Ferriss wrote about &#8220;mini-retirements&#8221; in the 4 Hour Workweek. Yes, the book is about bigger ideas than just outsourcing. It&#8217;s about crafting the life you want to live. Making it a reality. Here are a couple interviews about the mini-retirments: <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/05/29/using-mini-retirements-to-get-more-out-of-life-an-interview-with-timothy-ferriss/" target="_blank">Using Mini-Retirements to Get More Out of Life</a> and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/06/03/how-to-take-a-mini-retirement-tips-and-tricks-from-timothy-ferriss/" target="_blank">How to Take a Mini-Retirement: Tips and Tricks</a>.</p>
<p>We all envy teachers who get the summer off (or at least part of it). Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;wow, wouldn&#8217;t it be great to have 2 or 3 back to back months off work? Every year!&#8221; Would you agree with this statement: I&#8217;d rather make $60,000 and have 3 months off than $80,000 working the whole year. Yes, obviously. Well guess what &#8211; no one is going to just hand it to you. You have to go out and make it happen. (And don&#8217;t tell me you could live on 25% less money &#8211; you might have to make some changes but wouldn&#8217;t it be worth 3 months off a year?)</p>
<h1>Jobs</h1>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really awesome that I am earning a living on my own. Yes, I realize as an employee you do in fact have to earn your pay, but it&#8217;s different. You are dependent upon a company, which is dependent upon customers. I am dependent upon customers directly. Kind of like in the old days before corporations. Or like a fixie biker (a purist removing the middle man).</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t necessarily think jobs are bad. Heck, I still think I&#8217;ll have a traditional job again some day. Boy will it be different though! It will be because I want to be there, not because of money, career advancement, or even because you&#8217;re supposed to have a job. It would have to be a situation where I really believe in what we are building and the team / company are in a position to make it a reality. </p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>Goals are a whole lot easier to meet when you feel in control of your life. With this new power you might even set some goals!</p>
<h1>Happiness</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to realize how toxic an environment is until you remove yourself from it. My frustrations at work built up over time, but they were gradual enough that it wasn&#8217;t enough that I didn&#8217;t make any drastic moves. Just like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog" target="_blank">frog that slowly gets boiled to death</a>, I did not jump out of my job. I wasn&#8217;t able to notice the significant impact this had on the other areas of my life. </p>

<p>Memory is a funny thing. Some people remember everything from a decade ago crystal clear. Others can&#8217;t remember where they parked their car an hour ago. </p>
<p>Of course a certain amount of memory can be trained. I read part of the book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/159420229X" target="_blank">Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything</a>&#8220;, where a journalist with an average memory spends a year training for the U.S. Memory Championship. It&#8217;s an incredible insight into what is possible if you have the right system &#8211; check out a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html" target="_blank">Slate article</a> he wrote for a quick overview.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s only one type of memory and the author said he still loses his car keys. There is a completely different type of memory freaks that are even more interesting. There was an awesome 60 Minutes episode interviewing a handful of the rare people that have what they call &#8220;superior autobiographical memory.&#8221; If you ask them &#8211; &#8220;do you remember what you did on April 7th, 1973?&#8221; &#8211; they&#8217;ll be able to tell you exactly what they did that day, the day of the week, what they wore, and what they were thinking about. </p>

<p>Sleep is also crucial to your memory. I learned somewhere that the last few hours (5-8) of sleep are when most the transfer of memory from RAM (short-term) to hard-drive (long-term) happens. So if you don&#8217;t get a full 8 hours of sleep, you aren&#8217;t learning as effectively as you could be. The fact that people sleep less these days than a few decades ago can also be partially blamed for a whole bunch of other things, like getting fat. Maybe New York should mandate 8 hours of sleep a night rather than banning sugary sodas? Hard to tell which would be more effective, but one gets all the blame.</p>
<h2>Inconsequential Childhood Memories</h2>
<p>I got thinking about memory because of a couple memories I have from 4th and 5th grade. Recently I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with kids this age, so I&#8217;ve been going back into my past to see what I remember. Some of these things are so inconsequential, I have no idea why I remember them but not more important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We did mental math problems every day in Ms. Barth&#8217;s class &#8211; &#8220;Start with 7 &#8230; multiply by 3 &#8230; add 4 &#8230; divide by 5 &#8211; what&#8217;s the number?&#8221; Well I remember one time we did it, we started with the number of hours you sleep in a night. So I started with 9. I got it wrong because we were supposed to start with 8.</li>
<li>In Ms. Walker&#8217;s 5th grade class she read off everyone&#8217;s name and you were supposed to respond if you did your homework. One time I said &#8220;yes&#8221; and she thought I said &#8220;oven&#8221; (don&#8217;t ask me how). So from then on I would answer with a household appliance. But one time I didn&#8217;t do my reading and didn&#8217;t get to say an appliance. This was the start of my 15+ year run of becoming less cool every year.</li>
<li>We read Babe &#8211; they sat us down to explain the word bitch and that we shouldn&#8217;t use it.</li>
<li>The TV show South Park came out &#8211; I had a friend named Kenny and we thought it was funny he dies in every episode (even though we didn&#8217;t watch it, we just knew that it happened!)</li>
<li>We had a Tic-Tac-Toe tournament in our class. I made the finals where I faced off on the overhead projector against someone that also figured out how to win or tie every time. After we tied a half dozen times I got bored and tried something different so we wouldn&#8217;t just tie for all of time. I lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any memories from 4th or 5th grade that are just as inconsequential?</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Kickass quote from the author of Moonwalking with Einstein that can be applied to any skill you are learning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OK Plateau is that place we all get to where we just stop getting better at something. Take typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get appreciably faster at it. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s become automatic. You&#8217;ve moved it to the back of your mind&#8217;s filing cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it&#8217;s possible, of course. But you&#8217;ve got to bring the task back under your conscious control. You&#8217;ve got to push yourself past where you&#8217;re comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn from your mistakes. That&#8217;s the way to get better at anything. And it&#8217;s how I improved my memory.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/174/413832638_abfb4c1c22.jpg" title="hockey miracle on ice" class="alignnone" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>I am a competitive guy. Compared amongst Stanford &#8220;I must overachieve&#8221;rs, I am more competitive than most. Compared to the athletes I have encountered over the years, I am more competitive than most. Even compared to the Stanford athletes crew I roll with, I am more competitive than most. But I am quiet about it and the casual observer might never know.</p>
<p>Why is this? Why do some people show their fire while others keep it inside? More specifically, why am I the way I am? I have a theory.</p>
<p>It involves the demeanor of a favorite and that of an underdog. As a favorite you want to be intimidating. You execute perfectly. You don&#8217;t show emotion. Nothing affects you. If you hit a snag, it is simply an expected obstacle on your path to glory. If things are going well, it is as expected and no reason to celebrate. If you are winded or struggling, you hide it in hopes that your opponent will mistake you for a machine.</p>
<p>The mindset of an underdog is different. You want to place a hint of doubt in the head of the favorite. You want to show that you want it more. That you are willing to work harder. That you have luck on your side. You believe that momentum will have an actual affect on the next play, and maximize this momentum with celebration. If you are winded or struggling, you wear it as a badge of honor, in hopes of showing just how far you are willing to go to win.</p>
<p>In my competitive infancy, I was a favorite way more than an underdog (in most cases not due to my contributions, so this list is in no way bragging). In 7th grade I played on a basketball team that rolled through every youth team in the city. My freshman year I played on a football team that went undefeated in an area where football is a big deal. In high school I played on volleyball teams that made it to the LA section championship 4 years straight, in the best volleyball city in the country. My senior year of high school, I played on a volleyball team that won the club national championship in convincing fashion and apparently had the most top 50 recruits of any volleyball team in history. </p>
<p>This was the time that I was developing my competitive nature. In most cases when my team walked into the gym, we were better than you and we knew it. And this formed my demeanor and mindset in competition. To this day I act accordingly, even though I find myself an underdog more than not.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
&nbsp;<br />
An incident last Friday night got me thinking about this. I was a little bit stiffly (I got sick for the 2nd time in almost 4 years of being a vegetarian, which is way way way less than before) and was heading to bed around 10 to get a good nights sleep. But I figured I&#8217;d have a hard time falling asleep so I put on a movie and watch part of it. When I realized I had seen the Magnificent Sever before, I put in Miracle. Oops. 5 minutes in, I was wide awake. It got my competitive juices flowing instantly. Two hours later, the movie ended and I was wide awake. I was so jacked I was awake for another hour.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things people believe blindly without much evidence. You could consider these people lazy for not gathering enough information to make an informed decision. You could consider these people illogical for jumping to a conclusion immediately. You could consider them stubborn for not listening to contradictory facts. But this conviction to things you believe in can be extremely valuable. What are a couple things I blindly believe and logical reasoning won&#8217;t change my belief any time soon?</p>
<h3>Capitalism</h3>
<p>This is an area I have been thinking about a lot recently. I started a for-profit company in a space where many non-profits are trying to make an impact. When it comes down to it I believe strongly that capitalism is the best way to improve the world. As the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats. Of course there are certain non-profits that are necessary. But if you are providing a good or service of value to a customer that is able and willing to pay, you should collect, even if your primary aim is to help the world. Why? Because I believe it is better for everyone in the long run. I might not have the proof or even a strong argument, but it is good enough for me.</p>
<p>The fiction book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145" target="_blank">Atlas Shrugged</a> provides an entertaining look at the virtues of capitalism. Highly recommended.</p>
<h3>The impact of one person</h3>
<p>Can one person actually make an impact in a world with 7 billion people? In theory, sure. But can you or I? I have a blind faith that I can and that if everyone believed they could, the world would be a much better place (even if not everyone succeeded).</p>
<p>It just isn&#8217;t logical! Considering everyone has more than one problem (Jay-Z has 99 himself), there are billions upon billions of problems in the world &#8211; is it logical to believe just one person can make a dent? It doesn&#8217;t matter what your mom tells you, she is wrong, you&#8217;re not special.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You do the little job you&#8217;re trained to do. Pull a lever. Push a button. You don&#8217;t understand any of it, and then you just die.&#8221;</p>
<p> “You are not important. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.”<br />
-Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s one way to look at it&#8230; what a downer. But you know what? People have done it before:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8rwsuXHA7RA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Is it reasonable to believe you can make an impact? Nope, but it doesn&#8217;t matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.&#8221;<br />
-George Bernard Shaw, Maxims for Revolutionists</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it illogical? Yes, but that makes it all the more important:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hrCVu25wQ5s#t=33m51s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do you have any strong beliefs that you don&#8217;t care about the lack of supporting evidence or contradictory facts?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
&nbsp;<br />
I didn&#8217;t list a bunch of things people believe blindly because I want you to think for yourself and I want to avoid offending. It&#8217;s hard to think about things you never think about, but take a look at your assumptions.</p>
<p>Shout out to Adamson for <a href="http://www.rawinternets.com/post/18395919710" target="_blank">blogging</a> Sapolsky&#8217;s video a few months ago as well as the Fight Club quote. The whole video is intriguing and definitely worth watching, but only the last 3 minutes are relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Shout out to Fenner for getting me thinking about this last weekend. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/final-logo-no-background-sized-500.png"><img src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/final-logo-no-background-sized-500.png" alt="" title="breakout mentors" width="500" height="238" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1822" /></a></p>
<p>After returning from my travels I decided to go full-time on my after-school computer programming lessons business, <a href="http://breakoutmentors.com/" target="_blank">Breakout Mentors</a>. We provide a depth of learning that is not available anywhere else by pairing mentors to work 1-on-1 with young students with a long term focus. I&#8217;ve been back in San Francisco for roughly a month now, which means I have completed my first month as my own boss. It was everything I thought it would be &#8230; both good and bad!</p>
<p>You can imagine the good parts &#8211; complete freedom of your schedule, no annoying coworkers, no nagging bosses, and a sweet mustache (until I taught my first students at least). But I want to focus on my major take-aways, in the hopes that you are better prepared should you find yourself in a similar situation one day. Or even if you don&#8217;t, so that you know it isn&#8217;t as easy as it looks.</p>
<h2>The Lonesome Road</h2>
<p>Starting your own company is definitely the road less traveled, even here in startupland. One of the goals for myself while traveling was to discover to what extent I need to be surrounded by people. And I decided I&#8217;m fine being on my own for most of the day &#8211; so many of my friends are in SF, I could never be lonely.</p>
<p>But there is a spectrum of workplace socialness and I am at one extreme &#8211; a solo founder. Hell, even having just one person to bounce ideas off of and talk fantasy baseball would be great. Someone to share in the successes and failures. I&#8217;m not lonely, far from it. I spend a good portion of my days talking to people about Breakout Mentors. But no one else is on this long and winding road with me, so the road itself is lonesome.</p>
<h2>Fear and Doubt</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard about the emotional battle of starting a company from friends and the internet. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> has written extensively about it, coining terms like the &#8220;trough of sorrow&#8221; and &#8220;emotional roller-coaster&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an emotional roller-coaster. This was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for. In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ready to be shocked: I&#8217;m not a very emotional person. I like to think I&#8217;m too logical to be overtaken by emotions. Thus, I thought my emotional rollercoaster would be closer to Goliath Jr. than Goliath. Mark me down as one of those people that were surprised.</p>
<p>It takes just a couple emails from parents that are pumped about Breakout Mentors to get me jacked up. Unfortunately, it also takes just a few minutes for me to ponder &#8220;do I have any idea what I&#8217;m doing&#8221;, &#8220;is this really going to work&#8221;, and &#8220;is anything I&#8217;m doing actually making a difference&#8221;. Wuh-wuh-wuuuuuhhhhhhh!</p>
<p>My strategy is to combat the emotional roller-coaster with routines in order to put forward a consistent effort without thinking too much about it. During the lows I also remind myself why it is a goal worth pursuing. My execution of these strategies however leaves plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s All About Results</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no one to impress by working hard. Thus, hard work in and of itself is not valuable like it is in a normal job. Take this extreme example: your boss tells you to add 1 on the calculator over and over again. It&#8217;s urgent and very important. So you do. And you do a killer job, working 16 hour days until the project is done. Unfortunately it is soon discovered adding 1 is the wrong strategy and the company is going in a different direction &#8211; all your hard work is thrown out.</p>
<p>Even though your work produced no value for the company, people at least noticed how well you did on the project. You took directions from your boss and crushed it, producing more than anyone could have expected. That will come in handy when it&#8217;s time for the company to consider raises and promotions. </p>
<p>But in my situation, looking busy doesn&#8217;t accomplish anything. I&#8217;d only be fooling myself. Executing the wrong strategy perfectly is worthless. It&#8217;s all about results! If I pursue a marketing effort that leads nowhere (which I&#8217;ve already experienced a couple times), it is just wasted time. It doesn&#8217;t matter how hard I work. It matters how smart I work, then executing. </p>
<p>This is exactly what I want out of a job. No kiss-asses trying to look good or make their boss look good. No navigating a bureaucratic org chart to get buy-in for your ideas. It&#8217;s all me &#8211; time to figure out how good I really am.</p>
<h2>Happy Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Now that I have sufficiently warned you of the negative aspects, let me jump back to the positives.  I am able to use my flexible schedule to take a <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/back-to-school-my-first-class-since-graduating-4-years-ago/">class at Stanford</a> and enjoy San Francisco&#8217;s spring weather. I am learning a lot about myself and how to operate a business. I am being challenged. I have met some incredible people that I wouldn&#8217;t have if I found a paying job like is expected of me. Most importantly, I am adding a ridiculous amount of value to my students lives, whether or not it proves possible to economically reap the benefits &#8211; and that is a win-win!</p>

<p>The Blame Game is something I like to play. No, this does not mean projecting my faults upon others &#8211; do you really think that lowly of me? The Blame Game is where I assess the multiple factors of blame for a given problem. You will commonly see what I call the Blame Game used in civil lawsuits determining to what extent someone is financially responsible. A more commonly used term for this is comparative fault or comparative responsiblity. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain it with an real world example &#8211; determining who is financially responsible for a car accident when both drivers are &#8220;at fault&#8221;. Bob rolled through the stop sign drunk, but James was speeding and didn&#8217;t stop at all. The court would have to decide who is responsible for the damages &#8211; the judge might decide Bob is 70% financially responsible and James is 30%.</p>
<p>I use the Blame Game as a way to think through all the factors that contribute to a problem. While driving around New Zealand, I noticed that the FM radio reception is piss-poor. Why is this? Well Brian, there are a number of things that contribute, it isn&#8217;t just a simple answer. Ok, so let&#8217;s break it down into comparable responsibilities. </p>
<p>Of course there isn&#8217;t really a right answer, just something that you can defend. If you are so inclined, help me out by assigning some percentages:</p>
<p>1. Landscape (lots of mountains in the way)<br />
2. Lower frequency band than in the States<br />
3. Differences in how signal is broadcasted (for example using less power to send the signal)<br />
4. Shape of the earth (the spheroid bends away faster here, FM is line of sight)<br />
5. Other<br />
&nbsp;</p>

This type of thinking is particularly useful any time many factors contribute to something. Let&#8217;s not be content simply saying &#8220;the environment&#8221; shaped the outcome. What parts of the environment? Which is the breakdown of responsibility?</p>
<p>Our Blame Game answers can then be used to determine which corrective action will yield the greatest result (also useful would be estimates of how difficult each corrective action would be). Now you&#8217;re thinking like a product manager &#8211; effort and reward tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Yes, this is something that actually goes through my mind while alone. Not the nerdiest example either (it would probably involve maths (kiwis use &#8220;maths&#8221; rather than &#8220;math&#8221;)).</p>
