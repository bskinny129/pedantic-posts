			<p>I don’t have any coherent thoughts to share with you today, so I thought I would go with two completely disjointed things that I enjoyed in the last week.</p>
<p>The first is one of my favorite paragraphs I have read in a while (mainly because there are so many links). From a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/how-a-startup-pivots-the-tagged-story-so-far/" target="_blank">TechCrunch article</a> about how the startup Tagged underwent a major pivot:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, some context. Weâ&#128;&#153;re not at all unique. Many successful startups go through some form of pivot, changing their direction when their first idea was not successful. PayPal was <a href="http://www.halplotkin.com/cnbcs029.htm" target="_blank">beaming money between Palm Pilots</a>. YouTube was a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-10-11-youtube-karim_x.htm" target="_blank">video dating site</a>. Twitter was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/technology/31ev.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">group SMS</a>, which came out of a struggling Odeo. Pandora started as a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/technology/08pandora.html" target="_blank">B2B music recommendation service</a>. Groupon started as The Point, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/entrepreneurs-groupon-facebook-twitter-next-web-phenom.html" target="_blank">serving collective political action</a>. The list goes on.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a silly math video. Check it out if you like word problems that make no sense,  videos designed to look older than they are, or even just dry humor.</p>

<p>One of the first Pedantic Posts was about <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/personal-informatics-what-gets-measured-gets-managed/" target="_blank">recording various data about your habits</a> in the hopes of finding trends and improving your life. After hours of research, I ultimately decided that I didn’t want to record every aspect of my life. Sure there are tools that make this record keeping easier, but you still have to think about it. It is way too OCD to voluntarily start. </p>
<p>Today I bring the news that there have been great advancements in this field over the last 8 months. The most obvious gain is the ability to track certain activities passively – you just go about your life as you normally would and data is gathered automatically. This might not always be a good thing, but there is also a trend emerging to make this data more accessible to you. And since you have access to your data, numerous tools are popping up to help guide your analysis.</p>
<p>Facebook, Foursquare, and Twitter have an incredible amount of interesting information about your life and they are now willing to let you use it. It is yours to keep (and share). But you don’t want to have to scroll through hundreds of tweets over the last few months. Rather, you want to see how they trend over time and splice the data any which way suits your fancy. Well now you can.</p>
<p>A recent Wall Street Journal <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/12/22/everything-the-internet-knows-about-me-because-i-asked-it-to/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by Zach Seward opened my eyes to the possibilities. The author didn’t record any data on purpose – applications he was already using had plenty of data about him – Foursquare, Mint, iTunes, Last.fm, Google Earth, Google web history, and Twitter. All he had to do was use some third party tools to graph and analyze the data. </p>
<p>The results are astounding – a heat-map of where he spends his time (above), graphs of his temporary addictions to certain bands, how his music taste trends compared to other users, various graphs that show his most productive computer time and even his decline as an email potty mouth over the last two years. And these are just some of the possibilities. </p>
<p>What is next? It is still slightly too difficult for the general population to take advantage of this – most people don’t want to pull together various tools like <a href="http://www.graphyourinbox.com/" target="_blank">Graph Your Inbox</a> or <a href="http://www.wheredoyougo.net/" target="_blank">Where Do You Go</a>. But it will only get easier. Will your 2013 Foursquare heatmap become a lazy-man’s scrapbook that you can readily share and take with you anywhere? Only time will tell …</p>
<hr>
It is also a possibility that people will oppose having their data tracked automatically and actually do something about it. In other words stop using Google! Blasphemy, I know. Check out this “<a href="http://donttrack.us/" target="_blank">illustrated guide</a>” as to why all this automatic tracking is bad.<br>

<p>Isn’t “cellar door” the most beautiful combination of words that have ever existed in the English language? Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about this before! </p>
<p>The cult classic film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wqVHjK2bQs" target="_blank">Donnie Darko</a> introduced this concept to many of us; that the phrase “cellar door” is thought to be the one of, if not the, most beautiful sounding phrases in English (independent of the meaning). But of course this idea predates the 2001 movie. So where did this idea come from and who thinks about this stuff?</p>
<p>No one knows who first discovered the beauty in “cellar door.” Over the last hundred years it has popped up all over the place – it’s difficult to tell if each author thought of the idea themselves, or if the phrase was already commonly known. We do know that the first written use came in a 1903 novel with a character who “grew to like sounds unassociated with their meaning.” But the idea is believed to significantly predate this forgotten novel.</p>
<p>It has been said that “cellar door” was Edgar Allan Poe’s favorite phrase, and the word “Nevermore” in <a href="http://www.heise.de/ix/raven/Literature/Lore/TheRaven.html" target="_blank">The Raven</a> was used because of its similar sound. Was he possibly the originator? Doubtful. It looks the origin is going to have to stay a mystery… </p>
<p>The reason “cellar door” is used as an example of the most beautiful words in English isn’t because it objectively sounds better than any other words. It’s because its beautiful sound is in such stark contrast to its actual meaning. A cellar door is an ugly object and a perfect word.</p>
<p>What are some other examples of dissimilarity between meaning and sound? One that I can remember discussing on the school bus as a youngster is “gang”. Gangs are incredibly intimidating and are made up of scary men. Say the word gang five times. G-aaaaaaa-ng. Not so scary now, are they?</p>

Who out there is now going to name their daughter Selladore? (Actually used as a non-fiction character name.)<br>

<p>Are you a jerk? Well it just might land you a job, or better yet, you can start your own company with offensive customer service as a central tenet. Sure sounds like a fast track to bankruptcy, but that’s where you’re wrong. Not only can it be a positive for your company, it can be your entire marketing department!</p>
<p>The first business that comes to mind for intentionally poor customer service is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%27s_Last_Resort" target="_blank">Dick’s Last Resort</a> – a small chain of restaurants with rude, vulgar, and downright offensive waiters. Apparently people like being treated like shit – the owners initially opened a standard fine-dining restaurant that quickly went bankrupt. But with the strategy of setting themselves apart by being the sloppiest (hopefully not in the kitchen though) and with the worst servers you can imagine (in rudeness, not wait time) they have turned into a successful business.</p>
<p>That example was obvious. Everyone that goes to Dick’s knows their intentionally offensive customer service and goes for a good laugh. This next example masquerades as a regular old eyeglasses company, but you sure don’t want to talk with them on the phone. They take “any publicity is good publicity” literally – if they offend you enough to tell others, that’s a job well done!</p>
<p>A highly entertaining <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> explains the business strategy of DecorMyEyes: if a customer calls to dispute a transaction, give them hell! They are trying to cheat you out of your hard earned money! Exactly the opposite of “the customer is always right.” And apparently disputes happen all the time when your business is taking orders of high-end glasses and then ordering them on eBay or directly from France.</p>
<p>So how is this strategy a success?  <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/the-successful-business-strategy-of-poor-customer-service/#more-1059" class="more-link">Keep reading …</a></p>

<p>You are probably trying to work this out in your brain right now – how can you have an island within a lake, on an island that is within a lake, that all happens to be on another island? </p>
<p>Let’s start at the end and work our way down to the smallest island. The largest island in the Philippines is Luzon. On Luzon is a big freshwater lake, Taal Lake, that is roughly 15 by 10 miles. But the lake is not just water – on Taal Lake there is a medium-sized island formed by a volcano, appropriately named Volcano Island. Here’s where things get crazy. On Volcano Island is a lake sitting within the volcano crater. And just one more for good measure, in the crater lake is another small island (the speck in the middle of the picture above).</p>
<p>Does this remind anyone of the children’s song with the descriptive lyrics, forever zooming out and always ends with “and the green grass grows all around”?</p>

<p>Not so long ago, ice was a real luxury. In the early 1800’s only the extremely wealthy had ice to cool their drinks. It was harvested by hand during the winter and stored throughout the summer in a covered well. Someone’s miserable job was to harvest ice from a frozen lake! Even more shocking: some parts of the world never had ice. If you lived in an area that didn’t get snow during the winter, you certainly weren’t going to have ice to use during the summer.</p>
<p>In one of the most interesting business ventures I have heard about, ice became a major export of Boston. During the winter ice harvesting season, ice was cut from the top of Boston ponds and stored in insulated ice houses throughout the rest of the year. These ice houses were constructed in many areas that were blessed with warm weather year-round such as the American South, the Caribbean, and India. The ice harvesting companies would then deliver tons of ice by ship or train as quickly as possible, with much of it melting on the way. One huge 180 ton shipment of ice made the journey from Boston to Calcutta, arriving nearly 4 months later with only 100 tons of ice!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I posted about the controversial ways European countries are approaching <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/is-it-time-to-rethink-the-war-on-drugs/">drug reform</a>. Today I’d like to broach a topic that you will probably more closely relate to: speeding tickets.</p>
<p>Once again those Europeans have proven to be creative with their laws – in some countries the price of an excessive speeding ticket is linked to the wealth of the driver. For example, a Swiss millionaire received a $290,000 ticket. He was also a repeat offender, going twice the speed limit, and had a personal wealth over $20 million.</p>
<p>So what do you think? The same concept is also applied to drunk driving. Now what do you think?</p>
<p><a href="http://johnrlott.blogspot.com/2010/01/speeding-tickets-based-on-drivers.html" target="_blank">Someone</a> more qualified than myself (a Ph.D. in economics from UCLA) doesn’t think it makes sense. If you don’t vary the price of goods (cars, houses, food, etc.) for the wealthy, why would you do it for a speeding ticket? Here’s why: just because you are rich, doesn’t make you above the laws of the land! </p>
<p>If you can afford to pay the penalty, does that mean you have the right to do it? No way Jose! If the only penalty for driving too fast was a $100 fine, Bill Gates could drive as fast as he wants. He could just pay $100 every time he gets caught. The goal of the law is not to make the government money, but rather to keep the roads safe. </p>

<p>Stanford University is unique in the way they handle freshman rooming assignments. Freshmen aren’t allowed to choose who they want to live with, nor are they even told their assignment until they show up for the first day of orientation. Even if you and your best friend were lucky enough to get into Stanford, you certainly won’t be living with him freshman year.</p>
<p>The new students show up at the dorm the first day of orientation not even knowing their roommate’s name. No preconceived judging can take place, even in this Facebook world we live in. But that certainly doesn’t mean no one knows them – the entire dorm staff is required to memorize all the student’s names before they even show up. The students are greeted with enthusiastic personal cheers from a dozen people.</p>
<p>To make this process even more interesting – all the freshman roommate assignments are done by hand. Unlike other schools, no computer algorithm is used to quickly make assignments. Rather, two current students spend all summer playing matchmaker. The process has been subject to many rumors, but a recent <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2010/september/freshman-roommate-match-091410.html" target="_blank">Stanford News article</a> helped shed some light:</p>

<p>Last week I posted some of my favorite paradoxes (<a href="http://pedanticposts.com/going-beyond-the-chicken-and-the-egg-paradoxes-to-ponder">Click her for part 1.</a>) – here are some more gems: </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_recovery_paradox" target="_blank">Service recovery paradox</a>: “Successfully fixing a problem with a defective product may lead to higher consumer satisfaction than in the case where no problem occurred at all.”  This is the business flavor of the paradox, but it can be similarly applied to social aspects as well.  Someone who is born again or overcomes some failure that was entirely their fault, often garners more respect than those who avoided the pitfall in the first place.  Go figure.  Nice guys finish last, that’s why I’m a bad boy.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_paradox" target="_blank">Heat death paradox</a>: “Since the universe is not infinitely old, it cannot be infinite in extent.” Any hot object transfers heat to its cooler surroundings, until everything is at the same temperature.  If the universe were infinitely old there must have been enough time for the stars to cool and warm their surroundings. Everywhere should therefore be at the same temperature and there should either be no stars, or everything should be as hot as stars.  So the universe can’t be infinitely old, and since it can’t be infinitely old it cannot extend to infinity.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox" target="_blank">False positive paradox</a>: “A test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease, but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny.”  Consider a test with no false negatives, which gives a false positive only 0.04004% of the time, applied to a million people, in which 1 person in 10,000 is infected. The expected outcome would be: 100 people would receive a true positive, 400 people would receive a false positive, and 999,500 would would be correctly negative.  Thus, only 20% of the positive results are correct, even though the test is “over 99.95% accurate”.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance" target="_blank">Tolerance paradox</a> – “A tolerant person is antagonistic toward intolerance, hence intolerant of it. The tolerant individual is by definition intolerant of intolerance, but in so being must be intolerant of himself.”  Should the tolerant person be tolerant of intolerance in others?  So maybe the most tolerant people are those that are just completely indifferent to the cause?</p>

<p>Almost everyone has heard the paradox “which came first, the chick or the egg?”  That was so 2nd grade.  Here are some others for you to think about:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" target="_blank">Zeno’s paradox</a>: “In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.”  This is also known as Achilles and the Tortoise.  If Achilles (fast) is racing a tortoise (slow), but the tortoise is given a mile head start, by the time Achilles has reached where the tortoise has begun, the tortoise has advanced a measurable distance X.  In the time it takes Achilles to cover the distance X to where the tortoise currently is, the tortoise will have gone another measurable distance Y.  This will go on infinitely so that Achilles will come close, but never actually pass the tortoise.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect" target="_blank">Mpemba paradox</a>: “Hot water can, under certain conditions, freeze faster than cold water, even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing.”  If you have two cups of water – one at 95 degrees and one at 45 – and place them in the freezer, shockingly the hotter cup will freeze first.  Check out the link for insight into why and the story of the high school kid it was named after.</p>
<p>The Pinocchio paradox: “What would happen if Pinocchio said ‘My nose will be growing’?”  An awesome version of the classic “This sentence is false” paradox.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinker_paradox" target="_blank">Drinker paradox</a>: “In any pub there is a customer such that, if he or she drinks, everybody in the pub drinks.”  Either everyone in the pub is drinking , or at least one person in the pub isn’t drinking.  On the one hand, suppose everyone is drinking. For any particular person, it can’t be wrong to say that if that particular person is drinking, then everyone in the pub is drinking â&#128;&#148; because everyone is drinking. Suppose, on the other hand, at least one person isn’t drinking. For that particular person, it still can’t be wrong to say that if that particular person is drinking, then everyone in the pub is drinking â&#128;&#148; because that person is, in fact, not drinking.  Either way, there is someone in the pub such that, if they are drinking, everyone in the pub is drinking. Something to talk about next time you are in a pub not drinking.</p>
