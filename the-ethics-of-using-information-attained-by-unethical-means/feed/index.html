I would also argue that in the case of nuclear reactions, whether or not it was obtained ethically, the sole purpose was to build a terrifically devastating weapon.  We accidentally learned how to generate loads of energy and use that for good as a by-product.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i like the arguments and the article.  i have no answers to offer.  but here&#039;s some food for thought.  i&#039;d like to invoke the words of peter park&#039;s sage grandfather &quot;with great power comes great responsibility.&quot;   well information is power and by transitive property you could rephrase to read &quot;with more information comes more responsibility&quot;.  let&#039;s use the nazis and their horrific actions in another example.  

because of the nazis we have a powerful piece of information: human beings, when driven by fear, engaged in groupthink, and led by a &quot;cult-of-personality&quot; are capable of doing unthinkably inhumane acts.  this isn&#039;t news now, and it wasn&#039;t news pre-Holocaust.  BUT, it is unique in that it was (arguably) the first act of its kind to happen since the advent of modern media (e.g. radio, 1910; TV circa 1935).  And thus, the post-WW2 society was uniquely situated to leverage a rapidly evolving media to communicate, disclose, warn, and ultimately, INFORM the masses about these atrocities.  And we have accomplished that.  You learn about the Holocaust in grade-school here in the U.S.  I went on a class field-trip to the Museum of Tolerance in LA when I was in 8th grade.  I cried the whole way through it...it was terrifying.  When I was in Budapest, I went to the Museum of Terror that recounted the many sick and varied violations of human rights that occurred during the Holocaust AND the Cold War.  And when I was in Munich I went to visit Dachau, the first camp; like many camps it has been turned into a museum.  It has rooms and rooms full of posters, interactive videos, and exhibits explaining the events leading up to WWII, Holocaust, and post-Holocaust Germany.  You can walk into the rooms (or Blocks?) where the prisoners slept...essentially one on top of the other.  There are cremation rooms too--and those are hard to look at it.

All of these are examples of how we are taking information obtained, if not unethically, at the very least through an unethical event..for an ethical purpose: to educate people, promote tolerance, and warn future generations about what CAN happen.  I think in this case it would be UNethical not to use the information.  

Finally, what about ethically obtained information, for instance nuclear physics--fission and fusion, used for unethical purposes?  It&#039;s a two-way street.  Information is power--use it for good.

Also here is a quote I found by David Bohm, one of the homies from CAL who helped develop the atomic bomb, &quot;the universe is an unending transformation in flux whose previous states we are not privileged to know.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you think about the more extreme examples.. using information obtained via unethical means for good helps to honor those that were hurt in the process.  While the US government might have us believe we are condoning those actions, does helping someone survive a blizzard (hypothermia) mean we think the Nazis actions were correct?  Certainly not.  But it does mean that one life lost unnecessarily in the past can help to prevent suffering for someone in the future.

It gets more complicated for me when you think about everyday examples.  Take a poor kid in school who sneaks a peak at a classmate&#039;s exam and uses the information gained through unethical means for the greater good (one more kid is going to a good college).  Dumb example because it&#039;s completely self-serving and doesn&#039;t directly benefit anyone else, but when the &#039;good&#039; isn&#039;t &#039;that good&#039; and the &#039;bad&#039; isn&#039;t &#039;that bad&#039; it becomes a lot less clear...]]></description>
