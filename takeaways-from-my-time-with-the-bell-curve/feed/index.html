		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read Mindset, but I don&#039;t think The Bell Curve is an exact counter-argument. The Bell Curve takes a statistical approach, looking at the numbers and attempting to explain why they are that way. There are outliers in any statistic sample, but the book doesn&#039;t really focus on them. For example, Mindset would likely argue that a kid born to a high school educated single mother can achieve greatness with the right psychology hacks. The Bell Curve says, odds are the kid will be below average intelligence, make less money, and is more likely to do jail time. But there are exceptions. Its more of a macro look rather than examining what any one person can accomplish.]]></description>
