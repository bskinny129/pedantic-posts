		<description><![CDATA[I briefly forgot the #1 pedantic posts reader is a water expert! I should have consulted you before this post.

That all sounds like a lot of work ... what regions need to worry about this? Is it only a concern if you drink large quantities of tap water? Is there some website that summarizes all of this, where I can just type in my zip code and find out everything I need to know?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[true.  the other important thing to consider is where you live, and thus the quality of the water coming out of your tap.  i recommend doing research to check out where your local drinking water (or more generally potable water) comes from, i.e. what is the waterbody source (groundwater or reservoir are pretty typical).  Then check on the quality of that resource-EPA is your best bet on that one.  Because here&#039;s the thing- there is a lot of stuff in our surface water and a lot of things contaminating our aquifers.  You need to weigh that against the fact that there are virtually no water quality regs for bottled water.]]></description>
