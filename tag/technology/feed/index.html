<p>While typing, how many spaces do you put after a period?  I was taught to hit the spacebar twice after the end of a sentence.  Turns out not everyone does this.  I knew there were single spacers out there, but I thought they were heretical troglodytes.  Then I saw <a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/1621928/" target="_blank">this</a> poll result: with a huge sample of 44,000 people, 47% use a single space!</p>
<p>How does this happen?  I go for soooo long thinking almost everyone was on the same page, but in reality it is split down the middle.</p>
<p>Once I got over my ignorance as to how the rest of the world operates, I needed to know &#8211; how did Wikipedia standardize on which one to use?  Obviously if you are going to embark on an monumental distributed encyclopedia, all authors should agree to either use single or double space.  I could see this holding up the entire project and just turning into a huge debate to settle it once and for all.  Propitiously, the HTML of web pages renders on the screen the same way whether you do a single space or ten spaces.  Problem averted.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>It turns out the double space is a holdover from the typewriter days when fonts were monospaced.  Utterly useless now and really dating me beyond my years.</li>
<p></p>
<li>With my lofty aspiration to be the most efficient human alive, I must cut out the extraneous second space.  I&#8217;ll keep you updated on the progress.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Here is something else I found even more eye opening (although I will not discuss my personal proclivity): <a href="http://deadspin.com/5424415/sitters-vs-standers--the-great-wipe-hope" target="_blank">Sitters vs. Standers &#8211; The Great Wipe Hope</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Engineers love bridges.  I think it is because they appear so simple, but engineers appreciate how much thought and calculation are required.</p>
<p>Living in the Bay Area, we have two of the most impressive bridges in the country.  It&#8217;s a great time to be here because they are currently rebuilding the Bay Bridge, designed to last 150 years and withstand a whopping 8.5 earthquake.  Check out this short video showing how awesome it will be:</p>

<p>And for those of you that haven&#8217;t seen this famous video of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_%281940%29" target="_blank">how not to build a bridge</a>:</p>

<hr />
<p>Nerd note: In engineering classes we were taught that the reason the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed was because the wind provided a periodic frequency that matched the natural frequency of the bridge.  (Non-nerd note: think of a parent pushing a child on a swing &#8211; the parent (the wind) is providing a periodic push of the child (the bridge), who is moving back and forth at a frequency.  If those frequencies match the kid will swing higher and higher.)  The real cause was aeroelastic flutter &#8211; aerodynamic forces, not periodic wind gusts, that matched the natural frequency of the bridge.  There is a startup that created a <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/04/humdinger-wind-energys-tiny-turbine-is-ten-times-more-efficient.php" target="_blank">tiny wind powered generator</a> using this principle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/google1.jpg"><img src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/google1.jpg" alt="" title="google" width="512" height="277" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-626" /></a></p>
<p>Google didn’t become the behemoth that they are by having the best technology.  They didn’t invent a faster computer to retrieve the most accurate search results in .15 seconds.  They became the leader in search and online advertising by being creative &#8211; and they did it through auctions.  Yes, Google is the world’s largest auction company.</p>
<p>Have you noticed the advertisements that come up whenever you do a common Google search?  They show both on the top and side of your search results (see image) and match incredibly closely to what you are looking for.  Have you ever thought about how Google decides to place the accurate ads?  Behind the scenes a genius little auction is held for every search that takes place.</p>
<p>Advertisers place bids for what they would be willing to pay to show up next to search terms that they believe are close to their product.  Google also ranks the relevance of the ad using a complex algorithm.  These two pieces of data are combined to rank each potential advertisement.  Then a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" target="_blank">Vickrey auction</a> is held to determine the price each advertiser must pay and the order of the ads.  I highly recommend this extremely concise explanation from Wired magazine (only 226 words).</p>
<p>Well that isn’t so complicated, how much money did they make with that idea?  Sure one step of the process is technologically complex, but even if their relevance ranking was created in one day, it would be able to get the job done.  The real genius is applying an automated auction system to online advertising, optimizing for price and relevance while allowing the advertiser a high degree of control.  So that begs the question &#8211; where else can I apply an efficient auction process that will make me billions of dollars?</p>
<p><em>Of course there are a lot of reasons Google is where it is today, I don&#8217;t mean to oversimplify things.  But this simple auction is a good chunk of the $24 billion in revenue they made last year.</em></p>

<p>The radio is a perfect example of an old technology that we completely take for granted &#8211; do you know how it works or are you just cluelessly upset when all you hear is static?  These older technologies are much easier to wrap my head around &#8211; if a some guy in the 19th century could figure it out, I should be able to understand the basic idea.  I&#8217;m not going to focus on how a radio transmitter physically creates the signal or receiver is able to turn it into sound, but rather the basic theory and some interesting things to know.</p>
<p><strong>What is the major difference between AM and FM?</strong><br />
AM stands for amplitude modulation.  This means the sound determines the amplitude of the radio wave.  FM stands for frequency modulation &#8211; the sound alters the frequency of the radio wave.  The transmitter is able to turn the sound being created into the appropriate wave.  Here is an example of a sound and how it would look as an AM and FM wave:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif" title="radio wave AM vs. FM" class="aligncenter" width="256" height="200" /></p>
<p style="font-size:8pt;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amfm3-en-de.gif" target="_blank">Berserkerus</a></p>
<p>Another major difference is that AM radio waves are a much lower frequency than FM.  Think of AM having the wavelength of a football field and FM the ball.  In reality you can broadcast amplitude modulation or frequency modulation at any frequency, but high quality FM audio must be a high frequency to allow for the differences (or modulation) in frequency.</p>
<p><span id="more-362"></span><br />
<strong>Wait a minute &#8230;</strong><br />
As you may know, when you change the dial on your car radio you are actually telling it what frequency to listen to.  For FM this confused me &#8211; I am telling it an FM frequency to listen to, but the received frequency keeps changing depending upon the sound that is being transmitted.  In this case you are letting the receiver know a base frequency to listen to, but it still picks up signals that are close in frequency.  It is able to determine the sound by how far the received frequency is from the base frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start with AM</strong><br />
I thought that AM was just an older, cheaper technology and that FM was superior in every way.  Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>One advantage of a lower frequency (AM) is that it decays much slower &#8211; meaning it travels farther through objects (including air) before dying out.  You have probably noticed bass thumping through walls (in the club) much better than an equally loud shrill yell.</p>
<p>But the real advantage of using a lower frequency is the natural behavior of the wave.  At a low frequency the radio wave actually clings to the semi-conductive surface of the earth.  Furthermore, the waves that are propagated upwards into the atmosphere are often reflected off the ionsphere and back to earth.</p>
<p><strong>Why is FM so popular then?</strong><br />
Frequency modulation is the favored way of transmitting audio for a number of reasons.  First, you are able to create a much wider range of sounds with FM.  More importantly &#8211; if you have a car radio you probably have noticed this &#8211; less static!</p>
<p>AM waves become jacked up when around another source of radio emission at the same frequency &#8211; this can be anything from lights, power lines, or even car engines.  The radio wave you are attempting to listen to combines its amplitude with the &#8220;noise&#8221; to create a very different sound.  FM receivers do not care about the incoming wave&#8217;s amplitude, only its frequency, so these additional sources of radio emission do not create static over your music.</p>
<p>But high frequency waves (FM) do not propagate the same way as low frequency (AM).  FM waves behavior is similar to light &#8211; it does not cling to the surface of the earth or bounce off of the atmosphere.  They call this line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>What does this have to do with Lady Gaga?</strong><br />
Because FM radio is line of sight it only travels roughly 50 miles along the ground before the curvature of the earth causes issues.  Operating under the assumption that your car&#8217;s antenna is not 200 feet tall, FM radio stations build tall towers or broadcast from on top of a mountain in an attempt to reach more people.  FM generally also use more power to blast the decaying signal through mountains or other objects on the way to your receiver.  Further, if broadcasting music, the higher fidelity of FM is in high demand so the station will have to pay more for the rights to use the frequency (there are only so many frequencies available for a given area).</p>
<p>These all add up to being more expensive &#8211; if you want to broadcast in FM over a given area it is going to cost more than for AM.  Thus, FM radio stations are primarily hip new music like Lady Gaga with a lot of people to listen to the advertisements. AM is cheaper per mile covered and features great entertainers such as Merle Haggard!</p>
<p><strong>What else is cool?</strong><br />
The ionsphere reflection of AM radio waves is significantly more effective at night.  Try scanning your AM radio for stations during the day compared to at night &#8211; you will receive more stations at night and they will come through clearer!  Due to this phenomenon radio stations in the US are forced to reduce their transmission power at night.</p>
<p>During the early 20th century some AM radio stations were broadcast with 10 times the power used today.  Some of these stations were rumored to be heard worldwide.  (I couldn&#8217;t find a good source for this, so if you know where to look or have super-human Google skills I&#8217;d be interested.)</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laffy4k/367822192/"  target="_blank">Chris Metcalf</a></p>
<p>Technology was originally created with the intention of saving us time.  The cotton gin was created to save time processing cotton, the steam engine to save time over using horses for power, and computers to save time on calculations.  But where is all this free time?  It seems that people are busier and more stressed than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite the incredible pace of technological innovations in the last several decades, it has been ineffective in actually saving us time.  An incredible number of tools are available today that have never been available before, but we don&#8217;t know how to effectively use them to reduce stress and provide more leisure time.  It is not a limitation of the technology, rather our training on these technologies lags far behind &#8211; we just don&#8217;t take the time to learn how to use them effectively!</p>
<p><strong>The technologies that dominate our everyday lives</strong><br />
In the grand scheme of things cell phones and email are new technologies.  The majority of people got their first cell phone less than 10 years ago and email maybe a couple years before that.  Now we are combining the technologies &#8211; chances are if you bought a new cell phone in the last year or two it now has email on it.  The downside to these rapid technological advances is that we haven&#8217;t had time to properly learn the best way to use them.</p>
<p>Have you ever been talking to someone in person when their cell phone rings?  How is this person supposed to respond?  It is wonderful that you can be reached at any time of day by your friend 10,000 miles away, but at what cost?  The call disrupts your face-to-face conversation for a digital one.  Text messages are less obtrusive but the same principle applies &#8211; they dictate our lives and take us out of the moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-279"></span><br />
And what about email?  All day we are pelted with unimportant emails to sift though and interrupt whatever we were doing &#8211; it is taking you out of the real world and sucking you into the matrix.  We habitually check our email every 10 minutes just in case something important comes that you will have to respond to.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s wrong with how we do it now?</strong><br />
There has been a great deal of research into how well humans multitask, and the results are not what you will want to hear.  It turns out the human mind is not exactly designed for it &#8211; and yet we do it anyway!  The British Institute of Psychiatry showed that interruptions by email during a creative task dropped the person&#8217;s IQ by 10 points.  For comparison sake, this is is equivalent to not sleeping for 36 hours and twice the effect of smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that is fine, I don&#8217;t do creative tasks at work!&#8221;  Do you do serious mental tasks?  (I hope you do otherwise you are not challenging yourself and should find a new job, but that is for a different post).  A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/25multi.html" target="_blank">study</a> of Microsoft employees found that workers took on average 15 minutes to return to their serious mental task after being interrupted by email or instant messages.  Once distracted they would answer other emails or browse the internet rather than returning straight to their work.   These distractions add up to wasting 2 hours of productivity a day.  I am no different and neither are you!</p>
<p><strong>Training for cell phones and email</strong><br />
We need to be trained to ignore ringing cell phones and stop checking emails incessantly.  This is harder than it seems &#8211; it is exciting to get a phone call and we all want to receive a terrific email.  One of the main methods of time management theory is to batch your tasks so that you can spend a contiguous block of time focusing on one thing.  This is the type of training we need for our newest technologies!  We need to be trained to develop the discipline to ignore these interruptions and realize that they are not urgent.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is &#8211; we can actually adopt technology to help us better manage the forms of communication we are using.  How about a feature to only receive phone calls, text messages, instant messages, and emails from certain people during your predetermined productivity blocks of time?  Everyone else can wait until the end of your 2 hour productivity block before you respond.  Does anyone really need an immediate response other than your boss, wife, and top client?</p>
<p><strong>What about all this real-time push notification technology?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s terrific!  But you should only use it when you are not working on something else.  Believe it or not, you can wait up to 2 hours before knowing what Ashton Kutcher ate for lunch.  After your productivity block is done you can then take advantage of the real-time information services &#8211; but here is the key &#8211; fitting them into your schedule rather than letting twitter and similar services run your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will this training actually help?</strong><br />
Hopefully.  Of course new technologies are constantly being developed so we will have to adapt our training, however the focus remains the same: limit distractions during our productive hours.</p>
<p>Even though we are able to do all of our work quicker and more efficiently than ever before, we just find other things to fill the time rather than kicking back and relaxing.  Here is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Overworked-American-Unexpected-Decline-Leisure/dp/046505434X" target="_blank">The Overworked American</a> diving into the disturbing trend of how we spend our time.</p>

<p>The often quoted Peter Drucker said &#8220;what gets measured gets managed.&#8221;  If you can&#8217;t measure it you are merely guessing, not managing.  Of course he was referring to applying metrics to better manage a business, but the same principle applies to individuals as well.  How are you to optimize your life when you do not measure how exactly you spend it?</p>
<p><strong>Personal Finance</strong><br />
Personal finance is the best example of this &#8212; in order to get your spending under control and save money you first need to know where your money is being spent.  Track where your money is going, create a budget to control problem areas, and continue tracking to observe the improvements.  <a href="http://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint.com</a> is a terrific website to help individuals focus on tracking their expenses.  From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve tried to build a budget in the past and just couldn’t stick to it, we understand. Until now, trying to see where you’re spending and where you can cut back has been too difficult. But once you understand a few basic principles and start tracking your spending with Mint.com, you’ll be able to set and stick to realistic goals, easily and automatically.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mint.com has developed impressive technology to easily track and report on your spending &#8211; in turn allowing more people to stick to their financial goals.  This website is only one example in an abundance of new tools utilizing technology to help you track your life.  Beyond personal finance, there are similar services you can use to for almost any facet of your life.</p>
<p><span id="more-82"></span></p>
<p><strong>Tools of the Trade</strong><br />
There are a ton of tools out there to help you track your everyday life.  Depending upon what you would like to track you can find a service that will be able to help you easily gather the data and display it.  You can find a comprehensive list <a href="http://personalinformatics.org/tools" target="_blank">here </a>or <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/guide/" target="_blank">here</a>, but let me introduce you to just a couple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">Fitbit</a> is a tiny pod that you carry with you at all times.  Without any manual input it tracks your steps take, distance traveled, calories burned, and even some sleep statistics.  The best part is that it wirelessly uploads the data to their website where you can log in to view nice looking charts of your activity.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://your.flowingdata.com/" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="http://daytum.com/" target="_blank">tools</a> that allow for you to track any custom activity with as little data input as possible.  Rather than writing it down on a piece of paper to tally later, you submit it on the internet and it automatically takes care of the data crunching for you.  They attempt to make it as easy as possible by being able to input data from twitter or text message rather than requiring that you log into their website to record data.  This means just about anyone can quickly record an activity from their cell phone.  All you have to do is setup categories such as &#8220;Soda&#8221; and tweet a specific format that can be interpreted by their service, for example &#8220;d daytum Coke&#8221;.  Then you can visit their website to see a graphical representation of your data.</p>
<p><strong>What Should You Track?</strong><br />
I can’t tell you what you should track as it varies from person to person.  Where would you like to improve?  What are your problem areas?  What would be interesting to know?  What would you like to have a permanent record of?  Here are some ideas to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption &#8212; calories, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, vitamins, soda, caffeine</li>
<li>Measure &#8212; weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cognitive test</li>
<li>Exercise &#8212; time, type</li>
<li>Subjective (rate on a 1 to 10 scale) -– productivity, mood, diet quality, exercise intensity, weather, energy</li>
<li>Daily Time &#8212; TV, computer, video games, reading, sleeping, at work, with family, with friends</li>
<li>Travel &#8212; driving, flying, walking, running, public transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to know how diet, exercise, and the weather effect your happiness?  How about how alcohol and caffeine consumption effect your productivity?  Maybe you’d like to have a record of every time you traveled 50 miles from your home?  How many hours are you watching TV or playing video games?  Customize a tracking plan to fit your life!</p>
<p><strong>Crunching the Data to Optimize Your Results</strong><br />
The primary benefit of the data is that you can use it to draw conclusions about your life.  Often times it will provide hard evidence for something you already suspected – sometimes this evidence is all you need to actually take action to improve your life.  A secondary benefit is the permanent recording of your life, similar to a diary but better suited for data heads.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined you can create a personal annual report &#8212; the same as those published yearly by public corporations, but all about you!  Here are a couple of varying complexity created by Nicholas Felton, <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=5810" target="_blank">Dan Meyer</a>, and <a href="http://jehiah.cz/oh-nine/" target="_blank">Jehiah Czebotar</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you are not interested in publishing your data for the world to see, you can still play with it on your own.  Once you are able to visualize your trends you can consciously make decisions to improve.  Days you drink soda you exceed your caloric goal?  Cut that out in a jiffy!  Intense workouts improve your sleep quality for two days?  Guess you will be working out every other day!  Notice trends, improve your life – it’s that simple.</p>

<p>Yesterday I explained the pitfalls of <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/too-much-venture-funding/" target="_blank">too much venture funding</a>.  Whenever posting about a problem I will always attempt to follow up the next day with a potential solution.  My idea is a Venture Capital funded bank account to be used by the startup where every X dollars spent translates into a percentage point of equity.  The beauty in this model is that the startup receives the funding they need, but are incentivized to keeps their costs under control and become profitable in a hurry.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a fictitious hot new internet startup looking for series B funding to take them to the next level.  The offer they receive from KPCB is $10 million in exchange for a 40% in the company.  Sounds great right: a ton of money from one of the best venture firms at what the founders feel is a generous valuation.  Wrong!  Take that same valuation but avoid the trap of taking more money than you need.  Here is a potential counter offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2 million immediately for an 8% stake
<ul>
<li>This amount will certainly be needed before becoming profitable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The VC firm opens a bank account / line of credit for up to $8 million more where every $25k is 0.1% of equity
<ul>
<li>Forces the startup to watch their expenses rather than quickly burning through money without consequences</li>
<li>Protects startup from equity dilution (<a href="http://www.gaebler.com/How-Equity-Dilution-Works.htm" target="_blank">an excellent explanation</a>) by only granting equity to the VC for funding used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If things start to go downhill for the startup there must be some protection from the VCs simply closing the account.  Here are some potential rules:<br />
<span id="more-28"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Account must be open for a minimum 2 years or when all $8 million is spent.
<ul>
<li>In the event that the VC wishes to close the account after two years they are responsible for 3 months at the current burn rate (the monthly rate they are losing money: expenses &#8211; income).</li>
<li>Here is an example.  At the end of the two years the VC firm notifies the startup that they wish to cut funding.  The startup has spent 5 of the original 8 million and their current monthly burn rate is $200k.  With this rule the VC firm must leave $600k (3 months multiplied by $200k a month) in the account to get the startup through the next 3 months while they search for additional financing, miraculously reach profitability, or prepare for their grave.  The good news is that the VC fund lost $2.4 million less than they would have with their initial offer ($2 million immediately + $5 million for the first two years + $600k for the final three months)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If things go well for the startup the VCs must be protected against outside investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>No additional funding to the startup is allowed unless all $8 million is exchanged for equity
<ul>
<li>1 year in if the valuation of the startup skyrocketed this would prevent them from taking funding at the new valuation that has much better terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This deal should be attractive to VCs because they originally wanted to invest at the given valuation, although they are only getting a smaller portion of guaranteed equity.  An extra benefit is that if things do go well they get to continually invest at the old valuation &#8211; a year later if the valuation of the startup is $100 million they still get to invest at the original $22 million valuation.  This certainly sounds attractive.</p>
<p>But this idea could be made even more complicated.  Why have a linear relation between the funding taken and equity provided?  As the 2 year deadline draws near it should be much more &#8220;expensive&#8221; for the startup to burn through funding (because they should be profitable at this point and if they aren&#8217;t it is highly risky) &#8211; potentially $10k for 0.1%.  A function for the change in payout vs. time could be negotiated.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Venture Capital firms would go for this model but it is worth a try.  I know if I ever find myself in the position with a VC offer I will counter with this complex scheme.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gogoninja/2522352127/" target="_blank">Go Go Ninja</a></p>
<p>One pitfall for startups is taking on more funding than they need in exchange for a huge chunk of the company.  It is obvious that the reverse is a problem &#8212; not enough funding means the young company has to be instantly profitable and will not be able to rapidly bring in new talent.  Not as apparent but almost as dangerous is taking too much funding.</p>
<p>The examples are endless in the dot com boom.  Webvan, Kozmo, RealNames, eStyle, Upromise, Priceline WebHouse Club, 800.com, Autolines, and Pets.com are some companies that had north of $100 million in funding and went out of business.  After that debacle venture capitalists are more weary to hand out that kind of money.  Only a handful such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Zenga have crossed a $100 mil.  A further sign of caution is that in these latest examples the money often came well after the company had proven themselves with millions of users or by already being profitable.</p>
<p>Despite the regression in funding since the dot com bust, there still is too much money flying around for internet startups.  Websites that are a good idea but lack a monitization strategy can raise tens of millions of dollars with good connections and a little luck.  These aren&#8217;t large-scale manufacturing companies that need to purchase machinery or brick and mortar stores that need to purchase expensive inventory, they are websites that only need to buy a few servers.  They have no need for tens of millions.</p>
<p>What happens when a startup receives more funding than they need?</p>
<ul>
<li>It removes the sense of urgency to become profitable.</li>
<li>It makes it appear like the funding is a win, when really it is just a step in the process to having a profitable company, not the end goal.</li>
<li>The founders may become paper millionaires and lose focus.</li>
<li>The company loses control in the form of pressure from a VC firm with a huge vested interest.</li>
<li>The company owns less by selling equity for money they don&#8217;t need.</li>
<li>They spend the money foolishly because they can.  There were famous dot com heyday parties that cost over a quarter million.</li>
<li>They blow money on marketing.  Obviously marketing is important, but cash strapped companies are forced to be creative with their marketing and still get more results than a Pets.com Super Bowl commercial.</li>
<li>Overaggressive expansion.  Expanding before having a plan leads to unnecessary employees without direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we all agree that too much venture funding is a bad thing, what can we do about it?  Check back tomorrow for my idea.</p>
