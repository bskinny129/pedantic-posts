<p>A couple days ago I posted about the intriguing notion that <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/you-can-write-laws-for-the-united-states-of-america-how-to-propose-bills-in-congress/" target="_blank">anyone can write bills</a>, which with a little hard work and a lot of luck can become a law.  </p>
<p><strong>Open Source Movement</strong><br />
I just started reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594488843" target="_blank">“Drive”</a> which examines the motivation for human beings to behave the way we do.  The hypothesis is that a simple cost benefit analysis is not enough to explain human behavior &#8211; there are other factors that must come into play because we do not always act in our own best interest.</p>
<p>An obvious example of this is the current trend of open source software.  Why would anyone spend 20+ hours a week of their free time to work on open source programs?  THEY AREN’T PAID FOR IT!  But they do feel challenged, get the feeling of contributing to something larger than themselves, and develop their programming skills.  Sometimes this is enough to convince a software developer to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>A Wiki For Writing Bills</strong><br />
Let’s take the whole concept of Wikipedia and apply it to laws.  Anyone can contribute to bills on the Wiki and therefore the whole responsibility does not rest on any one person.  A mother in Ohio may work on one section, a farmer in California another, and a retired lawyer in Florida can make sure the wording is correct.  By combining our efforts we can accomplish much more than individually and hopefully patch up the holes in our legal system.</p>
<p>This is inherently more difficult than Wikipedia &#8211; whereas Wikipedia is based on facts, Wikilaw is based on opinion.  But this could be the best part about it!  Your goal should be to produce bills which both Republicans and Democrats support.  This can best be achieved with a bipartisan effort working together online on the same bill.  Once the bill is complete, the community can vote on it &#8211; if it passes it is time to find a sponsor, if not it is back to the drawing board.<span id="more-501"></span></p>
<p><!--moreKeep reading...--><br />
<strong>No Way in Hell</strong><br />
The naysayers will say that this will never work.  “No matter how many amateurs you gather, you can’t equal the ability and experience of politicians.”  This is where I am going to have to disagree.  Common sense said that the quality of Wikipedia was going to suffer because there were no qualifications needed to contribute.  In reality it is a self-policing environment that has produced surprising quality and amazing breadth.</p>
<p>Given the enthusiasm to contribute to human knowledge, I would expect the same contribution towards human laws.  Lawyers aren&#8217;t black-hearted &#8211; they want to help society just like everyone else.  Unfortunately, because everyone is awarded the right to counsel by the 6th amendment, there are plenty of lawyers representing the bad guys.  They could put their legal training to good use by editing bills on the Wiki, closing the very loopholes they know so well, and thus generating a warm-fuzzy feeling inside.</p>
<p><strong>Making it Easier for the Little Man</strong><br />
When writing the previous post I realized how difficult it would actually be to get a law passed.  Beyond the difficult legal diction in a bill, you have to find a Congressman to propose it and generate enough buzz to make the others care.  A Wiki could be a one stop site for all three.</p>
<p>Just as <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/" target="_blank">OpenCongress.org</a> provides Congress insight into how the public feels about proposed bills, Wikilaw would provide insight into the laws the public wants to create.  But what could really be exciting is the press that would come with a finished bill &#8211; a bill written for the people by the people!  How can you not get behind that?</p>
<p><strong>Take the Power Away From Lobbyists</strong><br />
Have you ever wondered who does in fact write the bills?  Well you can be darned sure most the time it isn’t the Congressmen sitting down by the fireplace with a glass of brandy (as I imagined).  An interview with an insider reveals it is most likely non-partisan staff lawyers under direction of Congress or lobbyists.  </p>
<p>Lobbyists write bills?  You better believe it.  And it appears to be more frequent in the state governments where there are less people paying attention &#8211; <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_15485061" target="_blank">up to 60% of the new laws passed</a>!  Why is this a problem?  They usually aren’t lobbying for the interest of the general populace, but rather for ways to enable their companies to make money.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is With Me?</strong><br />
I believe something should be done and a cooperative community like Wikilaw just may do the trick.  Do you think it would work?  Do you think strict rules would have to be put in place or could it be self-policing?</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/striatic/92859/" target="_blank">Hobvias Sudoneighm</a></p>
<p>Out of all the repetitive junk we were taught in school as kids, it is pretty interesting what actually stuck in my brain.  One of the things I remember learning back in the day is that anyone can write a bill for Congress.  This means you, despite never running for a political office in your life, have the opportunity to write laws for the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>Writing the Bill</strong><br />
Once you know the law you want to impose upon your fellow Americans, you have to put it down in writing.  This is the easiest part of the process, and it isn’t exactly straightforward.  Bills can contain hundreds of pages of lawyer language, making them very hard to understand for those who are not well versed in it.  I don’t blame the members of Congress for not reading every single bill that comes to vote.</p>
<p>So the first step is familiarizing yourself with how similar bills are formatted and the language they use.  Take a look at <a href="http://OpenCongress.org" target="_blank">OpenCongress.org</a> and imitate what you see &#8211; don’t worry, it’s not plagiarism.  It is probably a good idea to have a lawyer take a look to change wording as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Congress</strong><br />
This is where it starts to get difficult.  Even though you wrote the bill, it must be formally introduced by a member of Congress.  So the first step after writing the bill is to convince a Congressman to propose it.</p>
<p><span id="more-485"></span><br />
Representatives are supposed to serve the will of his or her constituents, so hopefully this won’t be too hard.  <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/findyourreps.xpd"  target="_blank">Check out this map</a> to locate your Representative and find their contact information.  If/when that doesn’t work you may have to get creative.  Who would agree with the bill?  Who is easily accessible?  Who has a history of introducing bills rather than just voting?</p>
<p><strong>Passing the Bill into Law</strong><br />
This is where the odds are stacked against you.  As you are probably aware, bills are introduced in Congress, go to a committee, and then sometimes passed into law.  A low 4% of bills introduced actually become laws.  But it gets worse &#8211; most of these are not laws at all, but stupid things like <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h4918/text" target="_blank">renaming government buildings</a> or <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1256/text" target="_blank">recognizing professional athletic achievements</a>.  The pass rate is closer to 1% when you disregard all of the junk bills.</p>
<p>So how do you help it to pass?  You get the word out and get people to stand up for it.  Not only did you need to find someone to introduce it, but you also probably need bipartisan support.  Find a congressman in both parties who will not only vote for it, but speak up and tell other members of the party.  The more buzz the better &#8211; hit the TV and internet hard.  Then pray.</p>
<p>Having never done it, that is all the advice I can give.  But I’m interested in doing gaining some first hand experience, so do you have an idea that you’d like to see a law?</p>

<p class="credit">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/punchup/2283770099/" target="_blank">Punchup</a></p>
<p>First, what is a second order effect?  I wanted to start this with one of those &#8220;Merriam-Webster defines second order effects as &#8230;&#8221; that you so often see in papers by freshmen in high school, but I refrained.  Let&#8217;s start with a first order effect.  This is the direct result of a change.  Taking it one level deeper, a second order effect is the result of the direct result of the change.  It is better explained by an example.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new tax break is created to give an $8000 rebate to first time home buyers this year.  A first order effect is that more people buy homes this year.  A second order effect is that less people buy homes next year because so many just bought houses this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the second order effect is often an overlooked consequence.  Laws, rules, and regulations are often put in place to create a change in behavior.  But what is the consequence of that change in behavior?  All too often we lack the foresight to look this far into the future, but there also could potentially be third, fourth, or fifth order effects!</p>
<p><strong>Title IX</strong><br />
Title IX&#8217;s regulation of college sports is an example that jumps out in my mind.  The intention was to make sure women and men have the same rights.  One area most effected by this is collegiate sports &#8211; women and men must be equal in both athletic scholarships and the male-female ratio of athletes needs to match the schools student ratio.  This is a tremendous first order effect &#8211; more women get to play sports and receive scholarships.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the school&#8217;s economic situation comes into play.  Football is the only sport that makes money and there is not a women&#8217;s sport with an equivalent number of players.  So if the school wants to have a football team, they will also have to have 5 women&#8217;s sports teams before they can even add another men&#8217;s sport.  A second order effect is that schools are (economically) forced to drop some of the less common men&#8217;s sports teams.  A third order effect may be that the sport loses popularity over time (wrestling is an example).  Fourth order?  How about we start losing the Olympic medal count to China because they train their athletic children to focus on a specific random sport.  Fifth order?  Communism wins.</p>
<p><strong>What does this have to do with communism?</strong><br />
Absolutely nothing, that was a stretch.  The point is, it is extremely hard to predict the result of a result of a result of an action.  The consequences of the action may outweigh the benefit of the initial goal &#8211; this is why Republicans often vote for less government intervention &#8211; it&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t want better healthcare, rather they believe the unintended consequences outweigh any improvement.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scragz/132750728/" target="_blank">Jason Scragz</a></p>
<p>I love attaining knowledge, but here is a puzzling question &#8211; is it ethical to use information gained in an unethical way?  If so, are we just supposed to turn a blind eye to how it was obtained and move on?  If not, are we just supposed to forget the knowledge we gained and pretend it never happened?  Neither option jumps out as the right answer, so let&#8217;s inspect a couple examples.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Information</strong><br />
How about an extreme example &#8211; let&#8217;s take a look at the Nazis, some of the least ethical people ever.  They did a whole series of messed up experiments on human prisoners that resulted in thousands of deaths and countless more ended with dismemberment, disability, or at the very least emotional torment.  Just to give you an idea, some of the tests were carried out to find out the the effects on the human body of extreme cold and heat, mustard gas and other poisons, altitude, and drinking salt water.</p>
<p>Today we know a lot about the limits of the human body because the Nazis forced thousands of people past the limit and did not stop until they were dead.  For example, we now know that you die from hypothermia when your body temperature reaches approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  Researchers today openly use the Nazi experiment data and are determined to see good come from all the deaths by using it to help others in the future.  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/naziexp.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good essay examining the ethical debate of using this data.</p>
<p><span id="more-200"></span><br />
<strong>Forgetting the Information</strong><br />
The official stance of the United States judicial system is to forget the information.  Of course you can&#8217;t tell someone to forget something and actually expect them to do it, but you can keep it from being used in court.  The most well known example of this is the Fourth Amendment prohibition of illegal search and seizure.  If the police don&#8217;t have the proper warrants to search for evidence or do not alert you of your rights, whatever evidence they find cannot be used against you in court.  It&#8217;s like it never happened.  This of course discourages illegal searches from happening in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>You Decide</strong><br />
It is up to you whether you try to create good from the bad by using the unethical information or rather throw it out so as to not promote the wrong behavior.  Win-Lose or Lose-Win.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kenmccown/3917497679/" target="_blank">Ken McCown</a></p>
<p>One day my friend was cutting a piece of delicious cheesecake when it was proposed to do a &#8220;you cut, I choose&#8221; method to split it evenly.  I took it a step further and told him to &#8220;Plessy v. Fergurson it&#8221; &#8211; meaning I wanted the pieces separate but equal.  Of course no one understood what I was talking about, no one laughed, and I myself was not even sure I quoted the correct Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>So I went online to verify my dorky joke and found the Supreme Court information available to be quite underwhelming.  You can find articles dozens of pages long about each particular case, but no concise summaries.  Here are some of the famous cases ruled upon by the Supreme Court and a short description of why it was so significant to the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Famous Supreme Court Cases</strong></p>
<p><em>1st tier</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Roe v. Wade (1973) &#8212; Outright abortion bans are unconstitutional</li>
<li>Marbury v. Madison (1803) &#8212; Judicial review (for Supreme Court)</li>
<li>Plessy v. Fergurson (1896) &#8212; Separate but equal (segregation)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2nd tier</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Miranda v. Arizona (1966) &#8212; Rights to counsel and to remain silent</li>
<li>Regents of CA v. Bakke (1978) &#8212; Affirmative action</li>
<li>Tinker v. Des Moine (1969) &#8212; Freedom of speech of students in public schools</li>
<li>Brown v. Board of Education (1954) &#8212; Segregated schools is unconstitutional</li>
<li>McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) &#8212; Constituation is supreme law of the land</li>
<li>Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) &#8212; Slave is not a citizen but property of his owner</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3rd tier</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Slaughter-House Cases (1873) &#8212; Limits privileges and immunities of state citizens</li>
<li>Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) &#8212; Right to court appointed attorney if unable to afford one</li>
<li>Griswold v. Conneticut (1965) &#8212; Individual&#8217;s right to privacy</li>
<li>Mapp v. Ohio (1961) &#8212; Evidence procured by illegal search or seizure is not permissible in court</li>
<li>Greg v. Georgia (1976) &#8212; Death penalty in not unconstitutional</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-60"></span><br />
<strong>Format</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9 justices (including the chief justice)</li>
<li>Nominated by the president and confirmed by majority vote of the Senate</li>
<li>Serve for life (unless death, retirement, impeachment)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interesting Tidbits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of justices is not fixed and can be decided by Congress</li>
<li>Anyone can be nominated (no age or birth requirements)</li>
<li>There have been only 12 rejections of nominations by the Senate in history</li>
<li>When the Senate is in recess the president can temporarily appoint a justice to the court without approval</li>
<li>There is no process in place for when a justice is incapacitated &#8211; still living, but unable to continue service or resign</li>
<li>Carter is the only president to complete at least 1 term but not have the chance to nominate a justice to the supreme court</li>
<li>They sit according to seniority.  Chief Justice in the middle and younger the farther out you go (right is better than left)</li>
<li>The order of the case name is who lost v. won in the lower court (petitioner v. respondent)</li>
<li>The Constitution does not grant the Supreme Court the power of judicial review, but supported from beginning and shown in Marbury v. Madison</li>
<li>The Supreme Court is very rarely &#8220;checked&#8221;.  There are only four instances of constitutional amendments overturning supreme court rulings</li>
