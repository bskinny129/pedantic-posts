<p>Technology was originally created with the intention of saving us time.  The cotton gin was created to save time processing cotton, the steam engine to save time over using horses for power, and computers to save time on calculations.  But where is all this free time?  It seems that people are busier and more stressed than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite the incredible pace of technological innovations in the last several decades, it has been ineffective in actually saving us time.  An incredible number of tools are available today that have never been available before, but we don&#8217;t know how to effectively use them to reduce stress and provide more leisure time.  It is not a limitation of the technology, rather our training on these technologies lags far behind &#8211; we just don&#8217;t take the time to learn how to use them effectively!</p>
<p><strong>The technologies that dominate our everyday lives</strong><br />
In the grand scheme of things cell phones and email are new technologies.  The majority of people got their first cell phone less than 10 years ago and email maybe a couple years before that.  Now we are combining the technologies &#8211; chances are if you bought a new cell phone in the last year or two it now has email on it.  The downside to these rapid technological advances is that we haven&#8217;t had time to properly learn the best way to use them.</p>
<p>Have you ever been talking to someone in person when their cell phone rings?  How is this person supposed to respond?  It is wonderful that you can be reached at any time of day by your friend 10,000 miles away, but at what cost?  The call disrupts your face-to-face conversation for a digital one.  Text messages are less obtrusive but the same principle applies &#8211; they dictate our lives and take us out of the moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-279"></span><br />
And what about email?  All day we are pelted with unimportant emails to sift though and interrupt whatever we were doing &#8211; it is taking you out of the real world and sucking you into the matrix.  We habitually check our email every 10 minutes just in case something important comes that you will have to respond to.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s wrong with how we do it now?</strong><br />
There has been a great deal of research into how well humans multitask, and the results are not what you will want to hear.  It turns out the human mind is not exactly designed for it &#8211; and yet we do it anyway!  The British Institute of Psychiatry showed that interruptions by email during a creative task dropped the person&#8217;s IQ by 10 points.  For comparison sake, this is is equivalent to not sleeping for 36 hours and twice the effect of smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that is fine, I don&#8217;t do creative tasks at work!&#8221;  Do you do serious mental tasks?  (I hope you do otherwise you are not challenging yourself and should find a new job, but that is for a different post).  A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/25multi.html" target="_blank">study</a> of Microsoft employees found that workers took on average 15 minutes to return to their serious mental task after being interrupted by email or instant messages.  Once distracted they would answer other emails or browse the internet rather than returning straight to their work.   These distractions add up to wasting 2 hours of productivity a day.  I am no different and neither are you!</p>
<p><strong>Training for cell phones and email</strong><br />
We need to be trained to ignore ringing cell phones and stop checking emails incessantly.  This is harder than it seems &#8211; it is exciting to get a phone call and we all want to receive a terrific email.  One of the main methods of time management theory is to batch your tasks so that you can spend a contiguous block of time focusing on one thing.  This is the type of training we need for our newest technologies!  We need to be trained to develop the discipline to ignore these interruptions and realize that they are not urgent.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is &#8211; we can actually adopt technology to help us better manage the forms of communication we are using.  How about a feature to only receive phone calls, text messages, instant messages, and emails from certain people during your predetermined productivity blocks of time?  Everyone else can wait until the end of your 2 hour productivity block before you respond.  Does anyone really need an immediate response other than your boss, wife, and top client?</p>
<p><strong>What about all this real-time push notification technology?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s terrific!  But you should only use it when you are not working on something else.  Believe it or not, you can wait up to 2 hours before knowing what Ashton Kutcher ate for lunch.  After your productivity block is done you can then take advantage of the real-time information services &#8211; but here is the key &#8211; fitting them into your schedule rather than letting twitter and similar services run your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will this training actually help?</strong><br />
Hopefully.  Of course new technologies are constantly being developed so we will have to adapt our training, however the focus remains the same: limit distractions during our productive hours.</p>
<p>Even though we are able to do all of our work quicker and more efficiently than ever before, we just find other things to fill the time rather than kicking back and relaxing.  Here is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Overworked-American-Unexpected-Decline-Leisure/dp/046505434X" target="_blank">The Overworked American</a> diving into the disturbing trend of how we spend our time.</p>

<p>The often quoted Peter Drucker said &#8220;what gets measured gets managed.&#8221;  If you can&#8217;t measure it you are merely guessing, not managing.  Of course he was referring to applying metrics to better manage a business, but the same principle applies to individuals as well.  How are you to optimize your life when you do not measure how exactly you spend it?</p>
<p><strong>Personal Finance</strong><br />
Personal finance is the best example of this &#8212; in order to get your spending under control and save money you first need to know where your money is being spent.  Track where your money is going, create a budget to control problem areas, and continue tracking to observe the improvements.  <a href="http://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint.com</a> is a terrific website to help individuals focus on tracking their expenses.  From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve tried to build a budget in the past and just couldn’t stick to it, we understand. Until now, trying to see where you’re spending and where you can cut back has been too difficult. But once you understand a few basic principles and start tracking your spending with Mint.com, you’ll be able to set and stick to realistic goals, easily and automatically.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mint.com has developed impressive technology to easily track and report on your spending &#8211; in turn allowing more people to stick to their financial goals.  This website is only one example in an abundance of new tools utilizing technology to help you track your life.  Beyond personal finance, there are similar services you can use to for almost any facet of your life.</p>
<p><span id="more-82"></span></p>
<p><strong>Tools of the Trade</strong><br />
There are a ton of tools out there to help you track your everyday life.  Depending upon what you would like to track you can find a service that will be able to help you easily gather the data and display it.  You can find a comprehensive list <a href="http://personalinformatics.org/tools" target="_blank">here </a>or <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/guide/" target="_blank">here</a>, but let me introduce you to just a couple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">Fitbit</a> is a tiny pod that you carry with you at all times.  Without any manual input it tracks your steps take, distance traveled, calories burned, and even some sleep statistics.  The best part is that it wirelessly uploads the data to their website where you can log in to view nice looking charts of your activity.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://your.flowingdata.com/" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="http://daytum.com/" target="_blank">tools</a> that allow for you to track any custom activity with as little data input as possible.  Rather than writing it down on a piece of paper to tally later, you submit it on the internet and it automatically takes care of the data crunching for you.  They attempt to make it as easy as possible by being able to input data from twitter or text message rather than requiring that you log into their website to record data.  This means just about anyone can quickly record an activity from their cell phone.  All you have to do is setup categories such as &#8220;Soda&#8221; and tweet a specific format that can be interpreted by their service, for example &#8220;d daytum Coke&#8221;.  Then you can visit their website to see a graphical representation of your data.</p>
<p><strong>What Should You Track?</strong><br />
I can’t tell you what you should track as it varies from person to person.  Where would you like to improve?  What are your problem areas?  What would be interesting to know?  What would you like to have a permanent record of?  Here are some ideas to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption &#8212; calories, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, vitamins, soda, caffeine</li>
<li>Measure &#8212; weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cognitive test</li>
<li>Exercise &#8212; time, type</li>
<li>Subjective (rate on a 1 to 10 scale) -– productivity, mood, diet quality, exercise intensity, weather, energy</li>
<li>Daily Time &#8212; TV, computer, video games, reading, sleeping, at work, with family, with friends</li>
<li>Travel &#8212; driving, flying, walking, running, public transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to know how diet, exercise, and the weather effect your happiness?  How about how alcohol and caffeine consumption effect your productivity?  Maybe you’d like to have a record of every time you traveled 50 miles from your home?  How many hours are you watching TV or playing video games?  Customize a tracking plan to fit your life!</p>
<p><strong>Crunching the Data to Optimize Your Results</strong><br />
The primary benefit of the data is that you can use it to draw conclusions about your life.  Often times it will provide hard evidence for something you already suspected – sometimes this evidence is all you need to actually take action to improve your life.  A secondary benefit is the permanent recording of your life, similar to a diary but better suited for data heads.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined you can create a personal annual report &#8212; the same as those published yearly by public corporations, but all about you!  Here are a couple of varying complexity created by Nicholas Felton, <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=5810" target="_blank">Dan Meyer</a>, and <a href="http://jehiah.cz/oh-nine/" target="_blank">Jehiah Czebotar</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you are not interested in publishing your data for the world to see, you can still play with it on your own.  Once you are able to visualize your trends you can consciously make decisions to improve.  Days you drink soda you exceed your caloric goal?  Cut that out in a jiffy!  Intense workouts improve your sleep quality for two days?  Guess you will be working out every other day!  Notice trends, improve your life – it’s that simple.</p>
