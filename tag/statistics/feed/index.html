<p>Situations arise from time to time where you are in a room with a whole bunch of strangers. They key to making friends and the opposite sex swoon?  Probability.</p>
<p>What are the odds that two people in the room have the same birthday?  Memorize some of these numbers so that you can spout them off, I guarantee you will be the coolest guy in the room &#8211; 9 people = 10%, 13 = 20%, 15 = 25%, 18 = 35%, 23 = 51%, 57 = 99%, 366 = 100%.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that you mention the assumptions before your new worshipers start poking holes in you numbers &#8211; random distribution of birthdays, no leap years, no twins, etc.  Then you can go into what is interesting &#8211; with only 23 people in the room, odds are two people share a birthday.  It only takes 57 people to jump to 99% probability, but to get to 100% you need to have 366 people.</p>
<p>Now to really make their mouths drop.  How many people would it take for the odds to be in your favor for someone having the same birthday as you? 253.  They may question you because this is much higher than 365/2, but stick to your guns and point out that two of the other people could have the same birthday.  How many people would it take for two to likely have a birthday within a week of each other?  Only 7.  Ya, but a random distribution is a hell of an assumption.  Oh really?  Actually the odds are slightly more in your favor because birthdays tend to clump &#8211; summer babies, C-sections aren&#8217;t on weekends, and so on.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one to set up on a tee for them: what are the odds that two people have the same half birthday?  If they can figure this out, you may just have found your soulmate.</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwlguide/102126657/" target="_blank">Joel Dinda</a></p>
<p>I recently came across a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25birth.html?_r=1" target="_blank">study</a> that examined how two brothers who are both professional baseball players approach the game differently.  The Berkeley researchers actually had a pretty good sample size to work with &#8211; over 700 brothers have played in the majors.  Their hypothesis was that the younger siblings take more risk.</p>
<p>Stolen base attempts are the most obvious element of the game to inspect.  The result?  Younger brothers are 10.6 more times likely to steal.  They also noticed the younger brother is more likely to be hit by a pitch which means they probably crowd the plate slightly more.  The research paper even extends beyond baseball as well &#8211; younger siblings are more likely to engage in dangerous sports across the board like football and skydiving.</p>
<p>This study is not proposing any new theories &#8211; older siblings are generally more conservative and younger ones <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124276" target="_blank">take more risks</a>.  So why is it cool?  Well first, I appreciate that it relates this idea to baseball.  More importantly, other studies have shown that risk takers are <a href="http://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20050919/are-risk-takers-happier" target="_blank">happier</a> overall.  Thus, through the transitive property of equality, younger siblings are happier.  QED.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is always listed as one of the happiest, most democratic, most liberal, and tourist friendly nations.  Boring!  Here are a couple interesting facts you probably don&#8217;t know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orange is not their official color even though that is all they wear at the World Cup and Olympics.  The official colors?  Red, white, and blue!  So why do they wear orange?  To honor the royal family, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Orange-Nassau" target="_blank">House of Orange-Nassau</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Marajuana is actually illegal in Amsterdam</a> (and all of the Netherlands), but the law is deliberately not enforced. &#8211; by leaving the law on the books they are in compliance with international drug agreements.  What is the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; policy of their judicial system?  A person can possess up to 5 grams and a &#8220;coffee shop&#8221; can have up to 500 grams as long as it doesn&#8217;t distribute more than 5 grams per person daily.  Because it is technically illegal the government only receives income tax on the proceeds, rather than <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0222.pdf" target="_blank">jacking up the tax rate like we do for cigarettes</a>.</li>
<li>The Netherlands is possibly the country with the most to lose from global warming &#8211; a whopping 50% of its land is less than 1 meter above sea level.  In only 200 years the portion of the Netherlands below sea level is expected to go from a fifth to a well over half.  Maybe that is why the are kicking the worlds butt at making use of renewable energy?</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lrargerich/3312316496/" target="_blank">Luis Argerich</a></p>
<p>A person with an irrational fear of flying is frequently told “you’re more likely to die driving to the airport than on the flight” &#8211; is this actually true or just calming words?</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at some statistics</strong><br />
From the perspective of a passenger in the car/airplane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatality per 88 million miles driven (excluding motorcycles which have a 25 times higher death rate and any pedestrians/bikers killed by cars)</li>
<li>Scheduled flights (mainly airlines) = 1 fatality per 64 million miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p>(These numbers would skew in favor of airplanes if you cared about how many people were transported.  But, knowing my readers as well as I do, you only care about yourself.)</p>
<p>It looks like the expected value of death favors driving, but I would argue that you should be trying to avoid fatal accidents all together &#8211; if you are in one, it is a crap shoot whether or not you are the one that dies.  This is definitely not a situation I want to be in, otherwise I would play Russian Roulette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatal accident every 76 million miles driven</li>
<li>Scheduled flights = 1 fatal accident every 2 billion miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the odds of surviving this so called Russian Roulette?</strong><br />
Each fatal plane crash averages over 30 deaths, which is only 42% of the passengers on the flights.  On the other hand each fatal driving accident averages 1.15 driver/passenger deaths.  Unfortunately it is harder to track the number of occupants or even cars involved in these collisions.  My approximation is 3 people involved &#8211; most cars have only the driver aboard, and the ones that do not are offset by solo car crashes.  If the number is 2.75, this would equal the 42% survival rate for being in a fatal plan crash.  Pretty darn close!</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span><br />
This is contrary to popular belief &#8211; the perception is that a fatal plane crash will have a much lower survivability rate than a fatal car accident.  From a National Transportation Safety Board study:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because a public perception is that aviation accidents are not survivable, the Safety Board also examined the proportion of occupants who survived in each accident for the period 1983 through 2000. Contrary to public perception, the most likely outcome of an accident is that most people survive. In 528 of the 568 accidents (93.0 percent), more than 80 percent of the occupants survived (figure 3). Accidents that result in complete or near complete loss of life, such as TWA flight 800, account for a small percentage of all accidents. Only 34 of the 568 accidents (5.9 percent) resulted in fewer than 20 percent of the occupants surviving.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fine, but what about all the car accidents that are not fatal?</strong><br />
When you consider all the scheduled flights that crash, only 4.3% of the passengers die!  Car accidents?  If we assume each car accident involves an average of 3 people, 0.17% of the passengers die.  So obviously plane crashes are more dangerous when considering life vs. death, but not by as much as you may expect.  Injuries are a horse of a different color &#8211; I don&#8217;t need any statistics to show that you are much more likely to get injured driving than flying.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the bottom line?</strong><br />
Per mile, you are slightly more likely to die from flying than driving.  The average flight in 2000 was 616 miles long &#8211; so unless you are driving 850 miles to the airport, you are more likely to die on the flight!</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>

<li>Some crash website</li>
<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-thomson/which-is-safer-the-drive_b_167106.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>*I like how they indicate plane crashes as survivable or not.  Apparently this isn’t determined by looking to see if anyone is alive &#8211; a 1987 flight that crashed in Romulus, Michigan had 1 survivor yet was classified “not survivable”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scragz/132750728/" target="_blank">Jason Scragz</a></p>
<p>I love attaining knowledge, but here is a puzzling question &#8211; is it ethical to use information gained in an unethical way?  If so, are we just supposed to turn a blind eye to how it was obtained and move on?  If not, are we just supposed to forget the knowledge we gained and pretend it never happened?  Neither option jumps out as the right answer, so let&#8217;s inspect a couple examples.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Information</strong><br />
How about an extreme example &#8211; let&#8217;s take a look at the Nazis, some of the least ethical people ever.  They did a whole series of messed up experiments on human prisoners that resulted in thousands of deaths and countless more ended with dismemberment, disability, or at the very least emotional torment.  Just to give you an idea, some of the tests were carried out to find out the the effects on the human body of extreme cold and heat, mustard gas and other poisons, altitude, and drinking salt water.</p>
<p>Today we know a lot about the limits of the human body because the Nazis forced thousands of people past the limit and did not stop until they were dead.  For example, we now know that you die from hypothermia when your body temperature reaches approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  Researchers today openly use the Nazi experiment data and are determined to see good come from all the deaths by using it to help others in the future.  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/naziexp.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good essay examining the ethical debate of using this data.</p>
<p><span id="more-200"></span><br />
<strong>Forgetting the Information</strong><br />
The official stance of the United States judicial system is to forget the information.  Of course you can&#8217;t tell someone to forget something and actually expect them to do it, but you can keep it from being used in court.  The most well known example of this is the Fourth Amendment prohibition of illegal search and seizure.  If the police don&#8217;t have the proper warrants to search for evidence or do not alert you of your rights, whatever evidence they find cannot be used against you in court.  It&#8217;s like it never happened.  This of course discourages illegal searches from happening in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>You Decide</strong><br />
It is up to you whether you try to create good from the bad by using the unethical information or rather throw it out so as to not promote the wrong behavior.  Win-Lose or Lose-Win.</p>

<p>The often quoted Peter Drucker said &#8220;what gets measured gets managed.&#8221;  If you can&#8217;t measure it you are merely guessing, not managing.  Of course he was referring to applying metrics to better manage a business, but the same principle applies to individuals as well.  How are you to optimize your life when you do not measure how exactly you spend it?</p>
<p><strong>Personal Finance</strong><br />
Personal finance is the best example of this &#8212; in order to get your spending under control and save money you first need to know where your money is being spent.  Track where your money is going, create a budget to control problem areas, and continue tracking to observe the improvements.  <a href="http://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint.com</a> is a terrific website to help individuals focus on tracking their expenses.  From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve tried to build a budget in the past and just couldn’t stick to it, we understand. Until now, trying to see where you’re spending and where you can cut back has been too difficult. But once you understand a few basic principles and start tracking your spending with Mint.com, you’ll be able to set and stick to realistic goals, easily and automatically.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mint.com has developed impressive technology to easily track and report on your spending &#8211; in turn allowing more people to stick to their financial goals.  This website is only one example in an abundance of new tools utilizing technology to help you track your life.  Beyond personal finance, there are similar services you can use to for almost any facet of your life.</p>
<p><span id="more-82"></span></p>
<p><strong>Tools of the Trade</strong><br />
There are a ton of tools out there to help you track your everyday life.  Depending upon what you would like to track you can find a service that will be able to help you easily gather the data and display it.  You can find a comprehensive list <a href="http://personalinformatics.org/tools" target="_blank">here </a>or <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/guide/" target="_blank">here</a>, but let me introduce you to just a couple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">Fitbit</a> is a tiny pod that you carry with you at all times.  Without any manual input it tracks your steps take, distance traveled, calories burned, and even some sleep statistics.  The best part is that it wirelessly uploads the data to their website where you can log in to view nice looking charts of your activity.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://your.flowingdata.com/" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="http://daytum.com/" target="_blank">tools</a> that allow for you to track any custom activity with as little data input as possible.  Rather than writing it down on a piece of paper to tally later, you submit it on the internet and it automatically takes care of the data crunching for you.  They attempt to make it as easy as possible by being able to input data from twitter or text message rather than requiring that you log into their website to record data.  This means just about anyone can quickly record an activity from their cell phone.  All you have to do is setup categories such as &#8220;Soda&#8221; and tweet a specific format that can be interpreted by their service, for example &#8220;d daytum Coke&#8221;.  Then you can visit their website to see a graphical representation of your data.</p>
<p><strong>What Should You Track?</strong><br />
I can’t tell you what you should track as it varies from person to person.  Where would you like to improve?  What are your problem areas?  What would be interesting to know?  What would you like to have a permanent record of?  Here are some ideas to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption &#8212; calories, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, vitamins, soda, caffeine</li>
<li>Measure &#8212; weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cognitive test</li>
<li>Exercise &#8212; time, type</li>
<li>Subjective (rate on a 1 to 10 scale) -– productivity, mood, diet quality, exercise intensity, weather, energy</li>
<li>Daily Time &#8212; TV, computer, video games, reading, sleeping, at work, with family, with friends</li>
<li>Travel &#8212; driving, flying, walking, running, public transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to know how diet, exercise, and the weather effect your happiness?  How about how alcohol and caffeine consumption effect your productivity?  Maybe you’d like to have a record of every time you traveled 50 miles from your home?  How many hours are you watching TV or playing video games?  Customize a tracking plan to fit your life!</p>
<p><strong>Crunching the Data to Optimize Your Results</strong><br />
The primary benefit of the data is that you can use it to draw conclusions about your life.  Often times it will provide hard evidence for something you already suspected – sometimes this evidence is all you need to actually take action to improve your life.  A secondary benefit is the permanent recording of your life, similar to a diary but better suited for data heads.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined you can create a personal annual report &#8212; the same as those published yearly by public corporations, but all about you!  Here are a couple of varying complexity created by Nicholas Felton, <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=5810" target="_blank">Dan Meyer</a>, and <a href="http://jehiah.cz/oh-nine/" target="_blank">Jehiah Czebotar</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you are not interested in publishing your data for the world to see, you can still play with it on your own.  Once you are able to visualize your trends you can consciously make decisions to improve.  Days you drink soda you exceed your caloric goal?  Cut that out in a jiffy!  Intense workouts improve your sleep quality for two days?  Guess you will be working out every other day!  Notice trends, improve your life – it’s that simple.</p>

<p>Abortion is a hot button issue in the United States and nearly everyone has an unwavering opinion &#8211; there is no argument that can be made here that will instantly change your belief.  Instead I will share with you some eye opening statistics regarding abortion and let you draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>I am not one to wholeheartedly believe in statistics as a statistic can be dug up (or created) to support any viewpoint.  My main issue with taking statistics at face value is that there can be numerous errors in the study which are reflected in the final data.  Is it truly a random sample?  Is it a big enough sample to draw any conclusions?  Was the study funded by an organization that had an interest in the results coming out a certain way?  Fortunately, abortion is not a difficult activity to track as nearly all abortions take place in a hospital or abortion clinic.  The healthcare industry accurately tracks everything &#8211; in a 2008 sample of 100 hospitals there were 4 injuries relating to slicing zucchini, including one for trying to slice it with a mandolin &#8230;</p>
<p>In the case of abortion the margin of error is largely irrelevant &#8212; are you even able to come up with a ballpark answer?  How common are abortions?  5% of all pregnancies?  10%?  20%?  40%?  Higher?</p>
<p>In the United States 20% of all pregnancies result in an abortion.  What&#8217;s interesting is that this number varies greatly across the country and the world.  The District of Columbia and New York are close to 40% while many rural states are under 10%.</p>
<p><span id="more-70"></span><br />
The variation within the United States is large, but it is huge when you compare countries with completely different cultures.  Russia and Greenland lead the world with half of all pregnancies ending with abortion.  At the bottom of the list are Hispanic nations such as Mexico, Panama, Chile and Portugal with less than 1%.  Is it mainly religious beliefs, economics, or culture than creates such large differentials?</p>
<p>Who are the women having all these abortions in the US?  Two facts combine to skew the statistics towards older women: the abortion rate peaked around 1990 and they have been alive longer to have more sex.  An estimated 40% of all United States women in their 40s have had at least one abortion!  If you take all women who are of childbearing age or have been in the last couple decades (ages 15 to 64), almost 30% of them have had an abortion.  This is shocking when you consider a non-trivial chunk of those women are virgins (mainly the teenagers).  Without diving into the numbers too far, we can conclude that over a third of sexually active women (15 to 64) in the United States have had an abortion!</p>
<p>There are 6.7 billion people living on this planet, but what if none of these abortions took place?  There have been approximately 1 billion abortions over the past 100 years with U.S.S.R / Russia accounting for one third, China accounting for one third, and the rest of the world making up the last third!  If those pregnancies were not aborted the world population would be closer to 8 billion (some of the aborted babies would have gone on to have children of their own).  We currently don&#8217;t have a solution for overcrowding, food shortages, and pollution, but can you imagine if it was 20% worse right now?</p>
<p>These statistics are certainly eye opening whether you view abortion as an issue or a solution to an issue.</p>
