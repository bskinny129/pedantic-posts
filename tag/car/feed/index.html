<p>A person with an irrational fear of flying is frequently told “you’re more likely to die driving to the airport than on the flight” &#8211; is this actually true or just calming words?</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at some statistics</strong><br />
From the perspective of a passenger in the car/airplane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatality per 88 million miles driven (excluding motorcycles which have a 25 times higher death rate and any pedestrians/bikers killed by cars)</li>
<li>Scheduled flights (mainly airlines) = 1 fatality per 64 million miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p>(These numbers would skew in favor of airplanes if you cared about how many people were transported.  But, knowing my readers as well as I do, you only care about yourself.)</p>
<p>It looks like the expected value of death favors driving, but I would argue that you should be trying to avoid fatal accidents all together &#8211; if you are in one, it is a crap shoot whether or not you are the one that dies.  This is definitely not a situation I want to be in, otherwise I would play Russian Roulette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatal accident every 76 million miles driven</li>
<li>Scheduled flights = 1 fatal accident every 2 billion miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the odds of surviving this so called Russian Roulette?</strong><br />
Each fatal plane crash averages over 30 deaths, which is only 42% of the passengers on the flights.  On the other hand each fatal driving accident averages 1.15 driver/passenger deaths.  Unfortunately it is harder to track the number of occupants or even cars involved in these collisions.  My approximation is 3 people involved &#8211; most cars have only the driver aboard, and the ones that do not are offset by solo car crashes.  If the number is 2.75, this would equal the 42% survival rate for being in a fatal plan crash.  Pretty darn close!</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span><br />
This is contrary to popular belief &#8211; the perception is that a fatal plane crash will have a much lower survivability rate than a fatal car accident.  From a National Transportation Safety Board study:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because a public perception is that aviation accidents are not survivable, the Safety Board also examined the proportion of occupants who survived in each accident for the period 1983 through 2000. Contrary to public perception, the most likely outcome of an accident is that most people survive. In 528 of the 568 accidents (93.0 percent), more than 80 percent of the occupants survived (figure 3). Accidents that result in complete or near complete loss of life, such as TWA flight 800, account for a small percentage of all accidents. Only 34 of the 568 accidents (5.9 percent) resulted in fewer than 20 percent of the occupants surviving.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fine, but what about all the car accidents that are not fatal?</strong><br />
When you consider all the scheduled flights that crash, only 4.3% of the passengers die!  Car accidents?  If we assume each car accident involves an average of 3 people, 0.17% of the passengers die.  So obviously plane crashes are more dangerous when considering life vs. death, but not by as much as you may expect.  Injuries are a horse of a different color &#8211; I don&#8217;t need any statistics to show that you are much more likely to get injured driving than flying.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the bottom line?</strong><br />
Per mile, you are slightly more likely to die from flying than driving.  The average flight in 2000 was 616 miles long &#8211; so unless you are driving 850 miles to the airport, you are more likely to die on the flight!</p>

</ul>
<p>*I like how they indicate plane crashes as survivable or not.  Apparently this isn’t determined by looking to see if anyone is alive &#8211; a 1987 flight that crashed in Romulus, Michigan had 1 survivor yet was classified “not survivable”.</p>

<p>The radio is a perfect example of an old technology that we completely take for granted &#8211; do you know how it works or are you just cluelessly upset when all you hear is static?  These older technologies are much easier to wrap my head around &#8211; if a some guy in the 19th century could figure it out, I should be able to understand the basic idea.  I&#8217;m not going to focus on how a radio transmitter physically creates the signal or receiver is able to turn it into sound, but rather the basic theory and some interesting things to know.</p>
<p><strong>What is the major difference between AM and FM?</strong><br />
AM stands for amplitude modulation.  This means the sound determines the amplitude of the radio wave.  FM stands for frequency modulation &#8211; the sound alters the frequency of the radio wave.  The transmitter is able to turn the sound being created into the appropriate wave.  Here is an example of a sound and how it would look as an AM and FM wave:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif" title="radio wave AM vs. FM" class="aligncenter" width="256" height="200" /></p>
<p style="font-size:8pt;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amfm3-en-de.gif" target="_blank">Berserkerus</a></p>
<p>Another major difference is that AM radio waves are a much lower frequency than FM.  Think of AM having the wavelength of a football field and FM the ball.  In reality you can broadcast amplitude modulation or frequency modulation at any frequency, but high quality FM audio must be a high frequency to allow for the differences (or modulation) in frequency.</p>
<p><span id="more-362"></span><br />
<strong>Wait a minute &#8230;</strong><br />
As you may know, when you change the dial on your car radio you are actually telling it what frequency to listen to.  For FM this confused me &#8211; I am telling it an FM frequency to listen to, but the received frequency keeps changing depending upon the sound that is being transmitted.  In this case you are letting the receiver know a base frequency to listen to, but it still picks up signals that are close in frequency.  It is able to determine the sound by how far the received frequency is from the base frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start with AM</strong><br />
I thought that AM was just an older, cheaper technology and that FM was superior in every way.  Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>One advantage of a lower frequency (AM) is that it decays much slower &#8211; meaning it travels farther through objects (including air) before dying out.  You have probably noticed bass thumping through walls (in the club) much better than an equally loud shrill yell.</p>
<p>But the real advantage of using a lower frequency is the natural behavior of the wave.  At a low frequency the radio wave actually clings to the semi-conductive surface of the earth.  Furthermore, the waves that are propagated upwards into the atmosphere are often reflected off the ionsphere and back to earth.</p>
<p><strong>Why is FM so popular then?</strong><br />
Frequency modulation is the favored way of transmitting audio for a number of reasons.  First, you are able to create a much wider range of sounds with FM.  More importantly &#8211; if you have a car radio you probably have noticed this &#8211; less static!</p>
<p>AM waves become jacked up when around another source of radio emission at the same frequency &#8211; this can be anything from lights, power lines, or even car engines.  The radio wave you are attempting to listen to combines its amplitude with the &#8220;noise&#8221; to create a very different sound.  FM receivers do not care about the incoming wave&#8217;s amplitude, only its frequency, so these additional sources of radio emission do not create static over your music.</p>
<p>But high frequency waves (FM) do not propagate the same way as low frequency (AM).  FM waves behavior is similar to light &#8211; it does not cling to the surface of the earth or bounce off of the atmosphere.  They call this line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>What does this have to do with Lady Gaga?</strong><br />
Because FM radio is line of sight it only travels roughly 50 miles along the ground before the curvature of the earth causes issues.  Operating under the assumption that your car&#8217;s antenna is not 200 feet tall, FM radio stations build tall towers or broadcast from on top of a mountain in an attempt to reach more people.  FM generally also use more power to blast the decaying signal through mountains or other objects on the way to your receiver.  Further, if broadcasting music, the higher fidelity of FM is in high demand so the station will have to pay more for the rights to use the frequency (there are only so many frequencies available for a given area).</p>
<p>These all add up to being more expensive &#8211; if you want to broadcast in FM over a given area it is going to cost more than for AM.  Thus, FM radio stations are primarily hip new music like Lady Gaga with a lot of people to listen to the advertisements. AM is cheaper per mile covered and features great entertainers such as Merle Haggard!</p>
<p><strong>What else is cool?</strong><br />
The ionsphere reflection of AM radio waves is significantly more effective at night.  Try scanning your AM radio for stations during the day compared to at night &#8211; you will receive more stations at night and they will come through clearer!  Due to this phenomenon radio stations in the US are forced to reduce their transmission power at night.</p>
<p>During the early 20th century some AM radio stations were broadcast with 10 times the power used today.  Some of these stations were rumored to be heard worldwide.  (I couldn&#8217;t find a good source for this, so if you know where to look or have super-human Google skills I&#8217;d be interested.)</p>
