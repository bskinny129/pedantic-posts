				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The youngest person ever has finished rehab &#8211; what a great success story!  After 3 months in rehab, a two year old Indonesian boy has successfully kicked his smoking habit.  Allegedly, he began smoking at 11 months old when his father gave him a cigarette to help ease a headache.  By the time he was 2 years of age, he was smoking 2 packs a day!</p>
<p>Ok, maybe under these special circumstances, completing rehab with flying colors is not a success story. What an epic failure of parents! How can they be such morons? You parents out there that give into your babies anytime a tear is shed &#8211; I hope you are strong enough to hold out if your kid was begging for a cigarette. It&#8217;s hard to believe anyone can be the perfect combination of a pushover and ignoramus, let alone both parents!</p>
<p>If the family could continue to afford 2 packs a day and the Indonesian government hadn&#8217;t step in, I&#8217;m sure this kid would still be puffing away. But this story also delivers a great deal of hope.  Hope because we now live in a world where it is no longer a possibility to be the worst parent &#8211; unless you actively try to do worse than these two Indonesians, I am quite sure you will surpass their low bar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/6/23/1277298945767/Henrietta-Lacks-006.jpg" title="henrietta lacks" class="alignnone" width="460" height="276" /></p>
<p>In 1951 a young black woman by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" target="_blank">Henrietta Lacks</a> died of cancer.  Her cancer was unlike any seen before, or since, and has transformed modern medicine &#8211; her cells are immortal!</p>
<p>Henrietta’s miraculous cancer cells reproduce outside of the body &#8211; in a culture dish cells typically only divide a few times before they die, but hers have been alive for almost 60 years!  Scientists found the incredibly fast growth rate of her cancer grew just as fast indefinitely in a test tube.  They believed her cells held the key to curing cancer and even making humans immortal &#8211; unfortunately these have yet to happen.</p>
<p>Her cells, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa" target="_blank">HeLa cell line</a>, have been sent all over the world for testing, and even out of this world (as in outer space).  Never before was it possible to do long term tests on human cells without testing on an actual human &#8211; the cell line would die after a couple days outside of the body.  With the HeLa line this was suddenly possible.  It has been used for testing the first Polio vaccine, as well as research into cancer, AIDS, radiation effects, sensitivity to toxic substances, gene mapping, and many other medical causes.</p>
<p>Today over 20 tons of her cells exist in petri dishes scattered across the globe.  It’s amazing that after all this time, doctors still have not discovered why the HeLa cells behave unlike any others.  In the last 60 years Henrietta Lack’s cells have been instrumental in advancing modern medicine &#8211; potentially in the next 60 years they will even help find a cure for cancer.</p>

<strong>More stuff:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>53 minute documentary: <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-way-of-all-flesh/" target="_blank">The Way of All Flesh</a></li>
<p></p>
<li>Henrietta Lacks was a black tobacco farmer in southern Virginia who was diagnosed with cervical cancer at 30.  Without her knowledge or permission, a doctor took a sample of her cancer cells (apparently this was normal at the time).  Two decades after Henrietta&#8217;s death her family started receiving calls for blood samples to learn more about the family’s genetics.  This is the first time they heard about her miraculous cells and all the medical testing for which they have been used.  They also wondered why it had been done without consent, and how modern medicine could be advanced so much thanks to Henrietta Lacks, but her own children could not afford health insurance.</li>
<p></p>
<li>One downside to the HeLa line is that it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contaminated_cell_lines" target="_blank">contaminated numerous other cell lines</a> over the years.  Doctors were pumped when they saw other types of cells reproducing indefinitely, but it turned out the sample was just contaminated with HeLa cells.  HeLa is so resilient it takes just one cell to make its way into a petri dish for it to multiply and ruin the entire sample.</li>
<p></p>
<li>There are a few immortal cell lines that exist in animals, most notably the contagious cancers found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_transmissible_venereal_tumor" target="_blank">dogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease" target="_blank">Tasmanian Devils</a>.</li>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/horiavarlan/4273224901/" target="_blank">Horia Varlan</a></p>
<p>Here’s a common quandary for you &#8211; if you could know exactly when you are going to die, would you want to find out?  For me the answer is pretty easy &#8211; no way Jose!  I don’t want to live my life neurotically counting down to my death.  But what if you draw the line a little farther back?  What if you could know the likelihood that you will have a certain disease in your lifetime?  Or even the trivial: would you like to be told some of your insignificant traits that you may otherwise never even know?</p>
<p><strong>Is this even in the realm of possibility?</strong><br />
If you recall from the pea pod example in junior high, each gene is made up of two alleles &#8211; with each allele either being dominant or recessive. To show the recessive trait both alleles must be recessive.  But for humans it is rarely this simple.  These genes combine in incredibly complex ways to make you who you are &#8211; most characteristics are determined by more than one gene.  Even though it is incredibly complex, I think it just a matter of time until every conceivable human trait is identified &#8211; it should be possible with enough data and large enough computers crunching the numbers. (<a href="http://pedanticposts.com/genetic-inherited-trait-mapping-would-you-want-to-know/#geek">geek tangent</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Affecting your lifestyle</strong><br />
What would I like to know?  Areas where I could potentially take action to prevent a calamity before it strikes, rather than just worrying for worrying’s sake.  The obvious example are lifestyle diseases such as lung cancer, skin cancer, heart disease, and stroke.  Am I in the top 1% of the population for genetic risk of heart disease?  If so you better believe I would be extra careful to watch what I eat and make sure I exercise.</p>
<p><span id="more-563"></span><br />
But there are other areas I could actively avoid if I had more information about myself.  What am I allergic to?  It is painful and sometimes dangerous to learn naturally in life that you are allergic to peanuts, milk, or bee stings.  Or is that a little joy of life?  How about if my lungs are extra sensitive to air pollution?  Do I have trouble producing a certain hormone or produce too much of it?</p>
<p>But here is where I would draw the line: what if you could know which diseases you and your spouse are both carriers for?  Would it stop you from having a child because there is a 25% chance she would be born with Huntington&#8217;s disease?  Autism?  How about diabetes?  Where do you draw the line &#8211; would you sit down and weight the severity of the disease versus the likelihood?  My vote is to not find out in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>The Inconsequential</strong><br />
What kind of stuff would be interesting to know?  Cases where it really doesn’t matter the outcome.  This category is not something that will change your life &#8211; in fact, some of them you could go your entire life without finding out!</p>
<p>Am I one of the 22% that can smell asparagus pee?  One of the 7% of males that are red-green color blind?  One of the 30% that can’t taste the bitterness of broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts (PTC)?</p>
<p>Bad news on any of these 3 questions will certainly not floor me or really change how I live my life.  It’s just something cool to know!  I’m all for <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/personal-informatics-what-gets-measured-gets-managed/" target="_blank">learning more about myself</a>.  The other school of thought is that these little discoveries are what life is all about &#8211; take out the surprises, no matter how small, and it would make life that much more boring.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Are there any other inherited traits that would be fun to know?</p>

<strong>Geek tangent:</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, you can represent the 3 billion DNA base pairs a humans in only 770 megabytes (each pair can be represented by two bits &#8211; 00, 10, 01, or 11).  The Human Genome Project is already doing something similar to this &#8211; I don&#8217;t understand what exactly they are trying to accomplish, but I think if they collected enough data they could find useful patterns.  The downside is it would take 270,000 terabytes of storage just to store the information for every American &#8211; even Google doesn&#8217;t have this much space (despite offering multiple gigs to each Gmail user &#8211; although they are incredibly secretive about it so no one really knows just how much storage they have).  BUT &#8230; 99.9% of the DNA pairs are identical in all humans.  So theoretically you would only need 270 terabytes of storage to store the relevant information &#8211; this can be purchased for as little as $16,000.  (Of course the computer connecting all of those drives is not something you can pick up at Fry&#8217;s, but the point is, this is in the realm of possibility.)</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarihuella/3474744375/">Sari Dennise</a></p>
<p>There is a big difference between eradication and elimination when it comes to diseases.  Disease eradication is when the global number of cases reaches zero.  Even if there is a vaccine available for a specific disease, eradication means no one will ever be in need of using that vaccine again.  Elimination is not as stringently defined &#8211; it can refer getting rid of the disease in specific regions or diminishing the cases to a negligible number of unlucky and impoverished people.</p>
<p>There have been a total of seven global attempts to eradicate human diseases.  4 failed (hookworm, malaria, yaws, and yellow fever), 2 are ongoing (polio and guinea worm), and only 1 was successful (smallpox).</p>
<p><strong>Smallpox</strong><br />
In the early 1950s roughly 50 million people a year contracted smallpox with a mortality rate north of 10%.  Shockingly, only 30 years later the disease was declared completely eradicated.</p>
<p>The first vaccine for smallpox was discovered in 1796.  By giving someone the similar cowpox virus, they were then immune from contracting smallpox (fun fact: the word vaccine has the Latin root vaccinus meaning of or from cows).  Unfortunately this was before the advent of FedEx so a timely delivery of the vaccine all over the world was not possible.  Thus, the disease persisted for another 170 years.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 60s a global initiative to eradicate smallpox began.  Any outbreaks were immediately quarantined and everyone who lived close by received a vaccination (I imagine it was just like the movie “Outbreak”).  Why did it take over 170 years from known vaccination to complete eradication?  It was as much a communication and education initiative as a medical one.  Any outbreaks of smallpox had to be immediately identified and a quick response was necessary to keep it from spreading.  This was simply not possible in the 1800s.</p>
<p><span id="more-529"></span><br />
<strong>Polio and guinea worm</strong><br />
There is currently an initiative to eradicate two more diseases from the face of our planet.  Polio has been eliminated from everywhere but the poorest countries &#8211; there are now less than 2000 cases per year.</p>
<p>Guinea worm is slightly different than the other diseases &#8211; it is not transmitted from person-to-person and there is no vaccine.  It is spread through drinking water that is not clean &#8211; currently only 4 countries still have water that contains the disease.</p>
<p><strong>What is next?</strong><br />
There are a number of diseases that have been eliminated from most of the world and are in consideration for complete eradication.  Malaria, measles, yaws, leprosy, rubella, lymphatic filariasis, and onchocerciasis are all on the list.  The decision to eradicate a disease or not is difficult &#8211; is it worth the economic and time resources to pursue when the disease does not threaten the general public health?</p>
<p><strong>What else is interesting?</strong><br />
US and Russia have not in fact destroyed the last remaining smallpox samples and they are still used in laboratories.  Even though no human has smallpox, it is still possible for the vials to be released and reintroduce the disease.  The destruction of these last remaining samples is called disease extinction and is the final step in the process.</p>
<p>The most important take away from this is that you do not need to be a doctor to make a difference in disease eradication.  The hard part is not diagnosing what disease a person has.  What is difficult is educating the at risk population and making vaccines available in the poorest, most remote regions of the world.</p>
<hr>
Bill Gates’ work on eradicating malaria is what piqued my interest.  He gave an interesting <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_unplugged.html" target="_blank">TED talk on disease and education</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="airplane over city" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3312316496_3c7017a8c1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lrargerich/3312316496/" target="_blank">Luis Argerich</a></p>
<p>A person with an irrational fear of flying is frequently told “you’re more likely to die driving to the airport than on the flight” &#8211; is this actually true or just calming words?</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at some statistics</strong><br />
From the perspective of a passenger in the car/airplane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatality per 88 million miles driven (excluding motorcycles which have a 25 times higher death rate and any pedestrians/bikers killed by cars)</li>
<li>Scheduled flights (mainly airlines) = 1 fatality per 64 million miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p>(These numbers would skew in favor of airplanes if you cared about how many people were transported.  But, knowing my readers as well as I do, you only care about yourself.)</p>
<p>It looks like the expected value of death favors driving, but I would argue that you should be trying to avoid fatal accidents all together &#8211; if you are in one, it is a crap shoot whether or not you are the one that dies.  This is definitely not a situation I want to be in, otherwise I would play Russian Roulette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving = 1 fatal accident every 76 million miles driven</li>
<li>Scheduled flights = 1 fatal accident every 2 billion miles flown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the odds of surviving this so called Russian Roulette?</strong><br />
Each fatal plane crash averages over 30 deaths, which is only 42% of the passengers on the flights.  On the other hand each fatal driving accident averages 1.15 driver/passenger deaths.  Unfortunately it is harder to track the number of occupants or even cars involved in these collisions.  My approximation is 3 people involved &#8211; most cars have only the driver aboard, and the ones that do not are offset by solo car crashes.  If the number is 2.75, this would equal the 42% survival rate for being in a fatal plan crash.  Pretty darn close!</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span><br />
This is contrary to popular belief &#8211; the perception is that a fatal plane crash will have a much lower survivability rate than a fatal car accident.  From a National Transportation Safety Board study:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because a public perception is that aviation accidents are not survivable, the Safety Board also examined the proportion of occupants who survived in each accident for the period 1983 through 2000. Contrary to public perception, the most likely outcome of an accident is that most people survive. In 528 of the 568 accidents (93.0 percent), more than 80 percent of the occupants survived (figure 3). Accidents that result in complete or near complete loss of life, such as TWA flight 800, account for a small percentage of all accidents. Only 34 of the 568 accidents (5.9 percent) resulted in fewer than 20 percent of the occupants surviving.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fine, but what about all the car accidents that are not fatal?</strong><br />
When you consider all the scheduled flights that crash, only 4.3% of the passengers die!  Car accidents?  If we assume each car accident involves an average of 3 people, 0.17% of the passengers die.  So obviously plane crashes are more dangerous when considering life vs. death, but not by as much as you may expect.  Injuries are a horse of a different color &#8211; I don&#8217;t need any statistics to show that you are much more likely to get injured driving than flying.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the bottom line?</strong><br />
Per mile, you are slightly more likely to die from flying than driving.  The average flight in 2000 was 616 miles long &#8211; so unless you are driving 850 miles to the airport, you are more likely to die on the flight!</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Government Safety Report*</li>
<li>Some crash website</li>
<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-thomson/which-is-safer-the-drive_b_167106.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>*I like how they indicate plane crashes as survivable or not.  Apparently this isn’t determined by looking to see if anyone is alive &#8211; a 1987 flight that crashed in Romulus, Michigan had 1 survivor yet was classified “not survivable”.</p>

<p>I have been a vegetarian now for long enough now to consider it a permanent life decision.  People ask me why all the time and I brush it off to avoid having a lengthy, serious conversation.  I don&#8217;t enjoy conversations where I feel I am defending my choices or trying to convince someone else how to live their life.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t do a lengthy post trying to convince my readers to give up meat either.  Instead, here is a 4 minute TED talk that gives a great introduction and proposes a 70% solution for those who fear committing all the way &#8211; &#8220;Weekday Veg&#8221;.  Hopefully this short video will pique your interest and lead you to further research the benefits of becoming a vegetarian.</p>

<p>Abortion is a hot button issue in the United States and nearly everyone has an unwavering opinion &#8211; there is no argument that can be made here that will instantly change your belief.  Instead I will share with you some eye opening statistics regarding abortion and let you draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>I am not one to wholeheartedly believe in statistics as a statistic can be dug up (or created) to support any viewpoint.  My main issue with taking statistics at face value is that there can be numerous errors in the study which are reflected in the final data.  Is it truly a random sample?  Is it a big enough sample to draw any conclusions?  Was the study funded by an organization that had an interest in the results coming out a certain way?  Fortunately, abortion is not a difficult activity to track as nearly all abortions take place in a hospital or abortion clinic.  The healthcare industry accurately tracks everything &#8211; in a 2008 sample of 100 hospitals there were 4 injuries relating to slicing zucchini, including one for trying to slice it with a mandolin &#8230;</p>
<p>In the case of abortion the margin of error is largely irrelevant &#8212; are you even able to come up with a ballpark answer?  How common are abortions?  5% of all pregnancies?  10%?  20%?  40%?  Higher?</p>
<p>In the United States 20% of all pregnancies result in an abortion.  What&#8217;s interesting is that this number varies greatly across the country and the world.  The District of Columbia and New York are close to 40% while many rural states are under 10%.</p>
<p><span id="more-70"></span><br />
The variation within the United States is large, but it is huge when you compare countries with completely different cultures.  Russia and Greenland lead the world with half of all pregnancies ending with abortion.  At the bottom of the list are Hispanic nations such as Mexico, Panama, Chile and Portugal with less than 1%.  Is it mainly religious beliefs, economics, or culture than creates such large differentials?</p>
<p>Who are the women having all these abortions in the US?  Two facts combine to skew the statistics towards older women: the abortion rate peaked around 1990 and they have been alive longer to have more sex.  An estimated 40% of all United States women in their 40s have had at least one abortion!  If you take all women who are of childbearing age or have been in the last couple decades (ages 15 to 64), almost 30% of them have had an abortion.  This is shocking when you consider a non-trivial chunk of those women are virgins (mainly the teenagers).  Without diving into the numbers too far, we can conclude that over a third of sexually active women (15 to 64) in the United States have had an abortion!</p>
<p>There are 6.7 billion people living on this planet, but what if none of these abortions took place?  There have been approximately 1 billion abortions over the past 100 years with U.S.S.R / Russia accounting for one third, China accounting for one third, and the rest of the world making up the last third!  If those pregnancies were not aborted the world population would be closer to 8 billion (some of the aborted babies would have gone on to have children of their own).  We currently don&#8217;t have a solution for overcrowding, food shortages, and pollution, but can you imagine if it was 20% worse right now?</p>
<p>These statistics are certainly eye opening whether you view abortion as an issue or a solution to an issue.</p>
<p><em>In your comments please be cognizant of the fact that many people hold strong beliefs on this topic.  This is not a forum for debate.</em></p>
