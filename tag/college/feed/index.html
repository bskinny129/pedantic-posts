<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13511355@N06/1375685165/">wohnai</a></p>
<p>Over the last couple years an exciting new trend has emerged amongst universities across the country &#8211; they are providing courses online for free!  Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, Columbia, UCLA, and John Hopkins are just some of the schools that have lecture videos of entire courses online.</p>
<p><strong>Why the heck are these schools doing this?</strong><br />
It is the free information movement.  Just like there was a free love movement in the 1970&#8217;s, there is a similar free knowledge movement in the early part of the new century.  Wikipedia is the epitome &#8211; its free information has become a part of the way we research just about everything.  Another manifestation of this is the huge open source software movement providing free software to the masses.  Examples are the Linux operating system, Mozilla Firefox web browser, and Android phone operating system.  It is a cultural and economic phenomenon that deserves much more attention than a few sentences, but there is not room in this post so I will refrain &#8211; just be sure to take advantage of it!</p>
<p><strong>What exactly are they offering?</strong><br />
It varies widely from school to school and even class to class.  The organization OpenCourseWare currently has 200 schools with 13,000 courses offered online &#8211; some just have the lecture videos, while others also have the assignments and exams complete with solutions.  Beyond what is posted you are on your own &#8211; there are no help resources such as teacher assistants or other class members to contact.</p>
<p><span id="more-376"></span><br />
<strong>What&#8217;s the catch?</strong><br />
Unfortunately just because these schools offer their course material for free, it does not mean you are able to receive a college diploma for free.  In fact, even if you watch all the lectures and complete all the assignments you will not receive any recognition whatsoever.  No diploma, no credits, no nothing.  All you get is the knowledge!  Sadly, getting a degree today isn&#8217;t so much about gaining knowledge as it is gaining the recognition for that knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>There has to be a way to receive credit</strong><br />
Well, there are a few different tests that can grant you college credits: AP, CLEP, and DSST.  The only problem is there are an extremely limited number of tests for college credit, meaning the vast majority of the 13,000 courses online do not have a corresponding test.  There are 30 AP tests ($86 each) accepted at 3,600 colleges, 33 CLEP tests ($77 each) accepted at 2,900 colleges, and 38 DSST tests ($80 each) accepted at 2,000 colleges.  You have to see if the college you attend (or are planning to attend) will accept the specific test, what their score requirements are, and any other nuances.</p>
<p>These tests also do not closely match the depth of courses offered online for free.  The AP, CLEP, and DSST tests are all for somewhat elementary subjects &#8211; courses that would fit your general education requirement in college and help you achieve the minimum number of credits needed to graduate, but nothing beyond that.  There definitely are not any AP tests that correspond to MIT courses &#8220;Principals of Digital Communications I&#8221; or &#8220;Control of the Manufacturing Process&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Well why not?</strong><br />
That is a great questions.  Obviously completing &#8220;Principals of Digital Communications I&#8221;, a graduate level MIT course, is more impressive than passing the AP Psychology exam.  It seems there are just too many distinctive courses offered to provide college credit tests for each.  Also, each university then has to decide which tests it will accept for credit and the minimum score required.  It is not an easy task.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t it an important task?</strong><br />
Yes, I believe it is important.  People need the motivation to go out and take these free online courses.  The student needs support when the going gets tough, and also recognition upon completion in the form of course credits.  The benefits of this movement could be huge &#8211; it has the potential to lower the cost of a college degree massively by paying $80 for a test rather than taking a $1200 course.  This could make college attainable for millions of individuals with internet access who currently do not have the money for college.  When the students do arrive at college in person, they will be ready for more advanced studies, hopefully leading to more graduate degrees.  </p>
<p><strong>Who is responsible for making this happen?</strong><br />
It is clear the government would see a benefit by both helping to relieve congestion at our overcrowded universities and a better educated populace.  However, a government solution would not be dynamic enough to adapt to the ever changing selection of courses offered for free online.  A government test could potentially be too easy as the AP, CLEP, and DSST test currently are &#8211; this forces each individual university to decide which tests they will accept, and the minimum score required.</p>
<p>The colleges themselves could create their own tests for passing out of a course and receiving credit.  For example, MIT could develop tests for the numerous online courses they offer.  This way MIT is assured the quality of the course as well as setting their own standards for difficulty.  The downfall is that this would result in reinventing the wheel numerous times with different standards for each college.</p>
<p>I believe the real solution must come from the private sector.  A company could work closely with the top universities to develop formidable tests across a wide array of advanced subjects.  If the best schools in the country agree to accept the results of the test for credit, the state schools with less stringent requirements should have no issue.  A private business would also be dynamic enough to adjust to the ever changing selection of learning material online and determine which ones closely match courses offered at schools across the country.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t particularly easy, but could be the easiest improvement we can make to our post high school eduction system.  Who is with me?  What other ideas or difficulties might there be around this idea?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rap videos are unequivocally my favorite way to learn.  Really any educational music video.  It started in my childhood with School House Rocks and eventually Bill Nye the Science Guy.   To this day I still love educational songs, but not so much the ones geared towards things you learn in 6th grade.  Believe it or not there are smart raps with collegiate level subject matter.</p>
<p>One of my friends from Stanford, Tom McFadden, created a series of rap videos about human biology.  He was a course instructor for the human biology program and created most the videos to help teach his students.  Even though it is not my favorite topic, I am completely engrossed by the videos and able to retain a lot of information:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9k_oKK4Teco&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9k_oKK4Teco&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/rappin-for-science/" target="_blank">Here is an explanation by Tom:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Since virtually all cells have the same genome, cell specialization (for example: whether a cell becomes a neuron or a skin cell) is largely controlled by which genes are actually transcribed in a given cell. This can be controlled by transcription factors – proteins which bind to DNA and interact with the cellular machinery to control gene expression. An important family of transcription factors are Hox genes, which control which body parts grow where.</p>
<p>Hox genes control where legs, wings, and antennae grow in the fruit fly (so mutating them leads to some strange creatures). These same Hox genes have been highly conserved during evolution, and control vertebrae specialization in mice and humans. This helps to bring home a main lesson of developmental biology: that creating different body forms isn’t so much about what genes you have, but how you regulate them.</p></blockquote>
<p>But my absolute favorite educational music video is &#8220;Fear the Boom and Bust&#8221; about the macroeconomic theories of John Maynard Keynes and F.A. Hayek.  It is professionally made and provides a hilarious account of Economics 101:</p>
<p><iframe width="634" height="357" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0nERTFo-Sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This quality of content comes about when a talented producer with an interest in macroeconomics realizes the popular media isn&#8217;t talking about monetary policy.  We need more people like this in the media.</p>
<p><span id="more-135"></span><br />
For the physicists out there, the &#8220;Large Hadron Rap&#8221; is an introduction to CERN&#8217;s Large Hadron particle collider in Switzerland:<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j50ZssEojtM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/j50ZssEojtM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>And finally, an absolutely absurd video &#8220;Protein synthesis: an epic on the cellular level&#8221;.  If you get bored skip ahead a little bit and drop some acid &#8230;</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u9dhO0iCLww&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u9dhO0iCLww&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Can you believe this was created at Stanford in 1971 and the narrator went on to win a Nobel Prize?  As embarrassing as it is, yes, this is what Stanford geeks do for fun.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are many videos  created by high schoolers, but not many from college or beyond &#8211; it seems like people lose interest in creating educational music videos immediately after graduating from high school.  It&#8217;s a darn shame because it sure is a fun way to learn.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daviddmuir/2125697998/" target="_blank">David D. Muir</a></p>
<p>Most people think the benefit of attending a top tier school is the ability to nab a high paying job &#8211; investment banking, consulting, CEO, etc.  Sure those opportunities are great, but I am going to argue that the real advantage is the ability to pursue work that the individual finds interesting.  Right now you are probably thinking &#8211; can&#8217;t anyone do that?  Yes, but a top tier degree enables you to do it without worrying about money &#8211; you have a great degree to fall back on if things don&#8217;t work out.  It&#8217;s not the maximum salary opportunities that matter, but rather the high minimum salary that can be expected with a degree from an elite university.</p>
<p>The focus of students at these schools is not merely passing versus failing &#8211; all the students admitted to top tier schools are capable of doing the work, in fact thousands of capable students are rejected every year.  Keeping this in mind, these students are going to have a focus other than passing and failing: grades, social life, sports, clubs, job, girls, etc.  I won&#8217;t go into what their focus should be in the post, only what they should do in the meantime &#8211; get a technical degree!  Not all college diplomas are equal, even if they do come from the same school.  Graduating with a technical degree will prove valuable later when it comes to your career.</p>
<p>Many college students make the mistake of choosing a major because it is easy and they will be able to get a higher GPA while working less.  A technical major is much more important for job demand than GPA.  In fact, leave GPA out of the consideration &#8211; after your first job, who cares?  The answer is graduate schools, but that is not a job.  Who is going to have a harder time quickly finding a job, someone with a aerospace engineering degree and a 3.1 GPA or someone with a classics degree and a 3.4 GPA?  These majors may be harder but it is well worth a sacrifice of a couple tenths off your GPA in exchange for job demand.</p>
<p><span id="more-72"></span><br />
A good major from a top school sets the minimum you can expect to make very high.  An engineer from Stanford will almost always be able to find a job with a sixty thousand dollar salary (keep in mind these are rough estimates).  Can you say the same about the classics major?  The classics major will likely have the same ability to land an eighty thousand dollar consulting job, but if that doesn&#8217;t work there isn&#8217;t an obvious fall back option.  Without some connections and a good amount of luck this individual may land down closer to the Stanford degree &#8220;minimum&#8221; forty thousand.  The same principle applies to degrees from the lowest ranked colleges as well, although the numbers would all be knocked down significantly.  A non-technical degree from one of these schools does not come with any job guarantees significantly above a high school education.</p>
<p>Running with this idea, I&#8217;d like to share my definition of job security.  It is not the security that you feel with regards to your current employment, but the ability to find a similar salary if you are suddenly forced to switch companies.  There will likely be several instances throughout your lifetime where you will be forced to unexpectedly find a new job &#8212; layoffs, bankruptcy, moving to a new city, or just plain fired.  No matter how big a control freak you are there are some situations that are completely out of your control.  In these emergency situations it is important to be able to expect a high minimum salary.</p>
<p>With this new definition of job security comes the ability to pursue something that you are interested in.  Unless your personal minimum salary bar is set high enough to support your lifestyle, it may not be prudent to switch jobs.  For example, a psychology major from Montana State has a job making good money that he hates.  This individual is not very likely to quit in search of a job that interests him because if it doesn&#8217;t work out he is screwed.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s examine a MIT graduate with a technical degree.  She is in a similar situation &#8211; hates her job but is making good money.  The difference is that she is in a position to switch jobs in search of something that interests her or even start her own company.  If this individual spends 6 months trying to start her own company which massively fails, she can easily go back to a job in her prior field and be able to support her lifestyle. All that she has to risk is 6 months of her time, but she has the peace of mind that after 6 months she can return to an equally payed, equally despised job.  As a result, graduates from top tier universities are much more likely to find work they are passionate about or strike it rich by starting their own company.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you have to be passionate about your technical degree, or that getting a tech degree should be <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/your-college-is-not-a-technical-school/" target="_blank">your reason for going to college</a>.  If you know your passion is 18th century French poetry then by all means you should major in it. But if you are like most college entrants and have yet to discover your passion, take the conservative approach in college by getting a technical degree &#8211; it will free you up to take risks later in your career.</p>
