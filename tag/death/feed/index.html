<p>There have been so many rock stars who have died at age 27 that there is a club named for them &#8211; the &#8220;27 Club&#8221;.  Not only did they all die at age 27, but they died under some shady circumstances.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones &#8220;drowned in a swimming pool&#8221; &#8230; <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1090439/Has-riddle-Rolling-Stone-Brian-Joness-death-solved-last.html">or was he murdered</a>?  Ironically 27 Club members number 2 and 4 dedicated tributes to the deceased star.</li>
<li>Jimi Hendrix took way too many sleeping pills and asphyxiated on his own vomit (which contained mostly red wine).</li>
<li>Janis Joplic OD&#8217;d on heroin because her dealer gave her too potent of a stash.  A good dealer always checks his potency.</li>
<li>Jim Morrison died of &#8220;heart failure&#8221; and no biopsy was preformed.  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-07-11-morrison-questions_N.htm">Or was it another heroin overdose</a>?</li>
<li>Kurt Cobain died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the face.  But was he able to pull the trigger with 3 times the lethal dose of heroin in his bloodstream?  If so that is an impressive tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistically this is an anomaly.  But is this just a weird coincidence or could there be an explanation behind it?  Is it plausible that successful musicians take absurd, suicidal risks at age 27, after becoming wildly popular?  If that isn&#8217;t weird enough, is it true that Kurt Cobain aspired to be a member of the 27 Club as a kid?  (As claimed by his sister in his biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heavier-Than-Heaven-Biography-Cobain/dp/0786865059">Heavier Than Heaven</a>.)</p>
