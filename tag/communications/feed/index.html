<p>The radio is a perfect example of an old technology that we completely take for granted &#8211; do you know how it works or are you just cluelessly upset when all you hear is static?  These older technologies are much easier to wrap my head around &#8211; if a some guy in the 19th century could figure it out, I should be able to understand the basic idea.  I&#8217;m not going to focus on how a radio transmitter physically creates the signal or receiver is able to turn it into sound, but rather the basic theory and some interesting things to know.</p>
<p><strong>What is the major difference between AM and FM?</strong><br />
AM stands for amplitude modulation.  This means the sound determines the amplitude of the radio wave.  FM stands for frequency modulation &#8211; the sound alters the frequency of the radio wave.  The transmitter is able to turn the sound being created into the appropriate wave.  Here is an example of a sound and how it would look as an AM and FM wave:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif" title="radio wave AM vs. FM" class="aligncenter" width="256" height="200" /></p>
<p style="font-size:8pt;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amfm3-en-de.gif" target="_blank">Berserkerus</a></p>
<p>Another major difference is that AM radio waves are a much lower frequency than FM.  Think of AM having the wavelength of a football field and FM the ball.  In reality you can broadcast amplitude modulation or frequency modulation at any frequency, but high quality FM audio must be a high frequency to allow for the differences (or modulation) in frequency.</p>
<p><span id="more-362"></span><br />
<strong>Wait a minute &#8230;</strong><br />
As you may know, when you change the dial on your car radio you are actually telling it what frequency to listen to.  For FM this confused me &#8211; I am telling it an FM frequency to listen to, but the received frequency keeps changing depending upon the sound that is being transmitted.  In this case you are letting the receiver know a base frequency to listen to, but it still picks up signals that are close in frequency.  It is able to determine the sound by how far the received frequency is from the base frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start with AM</strong><br />
I thought that AM was just an older, cheaper technology and that FM was superior in every way.  Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>One advantage of a lower frequency (AM) is that it decays much slower &#8211; meaning it travels farther through objects (including air) before dying out.  You have probably noticed bass thumping through walls (in the club) much better than an equally loud shrill yell.</p>
<p>But the real advantage of using a lower frequency is the natural behavior of the wave.  At a low frequency the radio wave actually clings to the semi-conductive surface of the earth.  Furthermore, the waves that are propagated upwards into the atmosphere are often reflected off the ionsphere and back to earth.</p>
<p><strong>Why is FM so popular then?</strong><br />
Frequency modulation is the favored way of transmitting audio for a number of reasons.  First, you are able to create a much wider range of sounds with FM.  More importantly &#8211; if you have a car radio you probably have noticed this &#8211; less static!</p>
<p>AM waves become jacked up when around another source of radio emission at the same frequency &#8211; this can be anything from lights, power lines, or even car engines.  The radio wave you are attempting to listen to combines its amplitude with the &#8220;noise&#8221; to create a very different sound.  FM receivers do not care about the incoming wave&#8217;s amplitude, only its frequency, so these additional sources of radio emission do not create static over your music.</p>
<p>But high frequency waves (FM) do not propagate the same way as low frequency (AM).  FM waves behavior is similar to light &#8211; it does not cling to the surface of the earth or bounce off of the atmosphere.  They call this line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>What does this have to do with Lady Gaga?</strong><br />
Because FM radio is line of sight it only travels roughly 50 miles along the ground before the curvature of the earth causes issues.  Operating under the assumption that your car&#8217;s antenna is not 200 feet tall, FM radio stations build tall towers or broadcast from on top of a mountain in an attempt to reach more people.  FM generally also use more power to blast the decaying signal through mountains or other objects on the way to your receiver.  Further, if broadcasting music, the higher fidelity of FM is in high demand so the station will have to pay more for the rights to use the frequency (there are only so many frequencies available for a given area).</p>
<p>These all add up to being more expensive &#8211; if you want to broadcast in FM over a given area it is going to cost more than for AM.  Thus, FM radio stations are primarily hip new music like Lady Gaga with a lot of people to listen to the advertisements. AM is cheaper per mile covered and features great entertainers such as Merle Haggard!</p>
<p><strong>What else is cool?</strong><br />
The ionsphere reflection of AM radio waves is significantly more effective at night.  Try scanning your AM radio for stations during the day compared to at night &#8211; you will receive more stations at night and they will come through clearer!  Due to this phenomenon radio stations in the US are forced to reduce their transmission power at night.</p>
<p>During the early 20th century some AM radio stations were broadcast with 10 times the power used today.  Some of these stations were rumored to be heard worldwide.  (I couldn&#8217;t find a good source for this, so if you know where to look or have super-human Google skills I&#8217;d be interested.)</p>

<p>Technology was originally created with the intention of saving us time.  The cotton gin was created to save time processing cotton, the steam engine to save time over using horses for power, and computers to save time on calculations.  But where is all this free time?  It seems that people are busier and more stressed than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite the incredible pace of technological innovations in the last several decades, it has been ineffective in actually saving us time.  An incredible number of tools are available today that have never been available before, but we don&#8217;t know how to effectively use them to reduce stress and provide more leisure time.  It is not a limitation of the technology, rather our training on these technologies lags far behind &#8211; we just don&#8217;t take the time to learn how to use them effectively!</p>
<p><strong>The technologies that dominate our everyday lives</strong><br />
In the grand scheme of things cell phones and email are new technologies.  The majority of people got their first cell phone less than 10 years ago and email maybe a couple years before that.  Now we are combining the technologies &#8211; chances are if you bought a new cell phone in the last year or two it now has email on it.  The downside to these rapid technological advances is that we haven&#8217;t had time to properly learn the best way to use them.</p>
<p>Have you ever been talking to someone in person when their cell phone rings?  How is this person supposed to respond?  It is wonderful that you can be reached at any time of day by your friend 10,000 miles away, but at what cost?  The call disrupts your face-to-face conversation for a digital one.  Text messages are less obtrusive but the same principle applies &#8211; they dictate our lives and take us out of the moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-279"></span><br />
And what about email?  All day we are pelted with unimportant emails to sift though and interrupt whatever we were doing &#8211; it is taking you out of the real world and sucking you into the matrix.  We habitually check our email every 10 minutes just in case something important comes that you will have to respond to.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s wrong with how we do it now?</strong><br />
There has been a great deal of research into how well humans multitask, and the results are not what you will want to hear.  It turns out the human mind is not exactly designed for it &#8211; and yet we do it anyway!  The British Institute of Psychiatry showed that interruptions by email during a creative task dropped the person&#8217;s IQ by 10 points.  For comparison sake, this is is equivalent to not sleeping for 36 hours and twice the effect of smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that is fine, I don&#8217;t do creative tasks at work!&#8221;  Do you do serious mental tasks?  (I hope you do otherwise you are not challenging yourself and should find a new job, but that is for a different post).  A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/25multi.html" target="_blank">study</a> of Microsoft employees found that workers took on average 15 minutes to return to their serious mental task after being interrupted by email or instant messages.  Once distracted they would answer other emails or browse the internet rather than returning straight to their work.   These distractions add up to wasting 2 hours of productivity a day.  I am no different and neither are you!</p>
<p><strong>Training for cell phones and email</strong><br />
We need to be trained to ignore ringing cell phones and stop checking emails incessantly.  This is harder than it seems &#8211; it is exciting to get a phone call and we all want to receive a terrific email.  One of the main methods of time management theory is to batch your tasks so that you can spend a contiguous block of time focusing on one thing.  This is the type of training we need for our newest technologies!  We need to be trained to develop the discipline to ignore these interruptions and realize that they are not urgent.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is &#8211; we can actually adopt technology to help us better manage the forms of communication we are using.  How about a feature to only receive phone calls, text messages, instant messages, and emails from certain people during your predetermined productivity blocks of time?  Everyone else can wait until the end of your 2 hour productivity block before you respond.  Does anyone really need an immediate response other than your boss, wife, and top client?</p>
<p><strong>What about all this real-time push notification technology?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s terrific!  But you should only use it when you are not working on something else.  Believe it or not, you can wait up to 2 hours before knowing what Ashton Kutcher ate for lunch.  After your productivity block is done you can then take advantage of the real-time information services &#8211; but here is the key &#8211; fitting them into your schedule rather than letting twitter and similar services run your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will this training actually help?</strong><br />
Hopefully.  Of course new technologies are constantly being developed so we will have to adapt our training, however the focus remains the same: limit distractions during our productive hours.</p>
<p>Even though we are able to do all of our work quicker and more efficiently than ever before, we just find other things to fill the time rather than kicking back and relaxing.  Here is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Overworked-American-Unexpected-Decline-Leisure/dp/046505434X" target="_blank">The Overworked American</a> diving into the disturbing trend of how we spend our time.</p>
