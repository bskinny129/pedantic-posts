				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/google1.jpg"><img src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/google1.jpg" alt="" title="google" width="512" height="277" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-626" /></a></p>
<p>Google didn’t become the behemoth that they are by having the best technology.  They didn’t invent a faster computer to retrieve the most accurate search results in .15 seconds.  They became the leader in search and online advertising by being creative &#8211; and they did it through auctions.  Yes, Google is the world’s largest auction company.</p>
<p>Have you noticed the advertisements that come up whenever you do a common Google search?  They show both on the top and side of your search results (see image) and match incredibly closely to what you are looking for.  Have you ever thought about how Google decides to place the accurate ads?  Behind the scenes a genius little auction is held for every search that takes place.</p>
<p>Advertisers place bids for what they would be willing to pay to show up next to search terms that they believe are close to their product.  Google also ranks the relevance of the ad using a complex algorithm.  These two pieces of data are combined to rank each potential advertisement.  Then a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" target="_blank">Vickrey auction</a> is held to determine the price each advertiser must pay and the order of the ads.  I highly recommend this extremely concise explanation from Wired magazine (only 226 words).</p>
<p>Well that isn’t so complicated, how much money did they make with that idea?  Sure one step of the process is technologically complex, but even if their relevance ranking was created in one day, it would be able to get the job done.  The real genius is applying an automated auction system to online advertising, optimizing for price and relevance while allowing the advertiser a high degree of control.  So that begs the question &#8211; where else can I apply an efficient auction process that will make me billions of dollars?</p>
<p><em>Of course there are a lot of reasons Google is where it is today, I don&#8217;t mean to oversimplify things.  But this simple auction is a good chunk of the $24 billion in revenue they made last year.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/emdot/32815499/" target="_blank">Marya</a></p>
<p>A couple of my friends have told me that Pedantic Posts is the only blog they read.  I was shocked that these very intelligent people don’t take advantage of this relatively new communication medium.  I personally only started reading blogs a few years ago (and thought the word “blog” moronic at the time), but since have come to realize how valuable they are as a source of information.  Here are the top 3 reasons:</p>
<p><strong>An opportunity to hang out with people much smarter than you</strong><br />
Some incredibly smart people are willing to share their thoughts online for everyone to enjoy.  Individuals such as marketing guru <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>, venture capitalist <a href="http://www.avc.com/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a>, serial entrepreneur <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/" target="_blank">Marc Andreesen</a>, and the capricious <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a>.  No matter the subject that interests you, there is probably an expert blogging about it.</p>
<p>You may be blessed to hang around brilliant individuals in both your business and personal life.  Even if this is the case, odds are you only discuss the same handful of things over and over again, which leads us to the next reason to read blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure to new ideas</strong><br />
One of the first things I learned about via blogs was <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/" target="_blank">polyphasic sleep</a> (where you sleep 20-30 minutes every 3-4 hours).  While I am not personally interested in drastically changing my sleep schedule, I enjoyed reading about this new idea.  I realized there are people in this world doing interesting things and sharing them in the form of short posts that take less than 10 minutes to read.</p>
<p><span id="more-439"></span><br />
To speak in generalities, we surround ourselves with friends who are similar to ourselves.  Blogs give us the opportunity to diversify our exposure better than any other medium.</p>
<p><strong>The main advantage: brevity</strong><br />
There are other ways to gain exposure to new ideas &#8211; books exist for every topic you can imagine.  But blog posts have the advantage of being much shorter.  They give you exposure to the idea while not taking up a significant portion of your life.  If you are interested in learning more about the subject you can research further online or pick up a book at your local library.</p>
<p>You should take advantage of this brevity.  I don’t know much about world affairs or foreign policy, nor would I list either as an interest of mine.  Because I know I don’t want to read humongous books on the topic, I would much rather seek out a blog to keep me informed.  <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/index.html" target="_blank">Thomas Friedman’s New York Times opinion articles</a> are effectively blog posts in the newspaper every few days, and serve as my only exposure to foreign policy and most foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Another example is Ron Paul who comes off as an loony on TV because he spouts numerous radical ideas in only 3 minutes of air time.  If you want to judge anyone you should attempt to understand where they are coming from &#8211; once again bloggers are the best source for short articles about <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/blog" target="_blank">everything Ron Paul believes in</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In closing</strong><br />
You should try to hang around smart people as much as possible and expose yourself to new ideas &#8211; blogs are the the most efficient way.  Hopefully, the benefits allow you to overlook the awkward appellation “blogs” and you come to appreciate them as much as I have.</p>

		<title>Godwin&#8217;s Law of Nazi Analogies &#8211; A Warning that You&#8217;re in Danger of Being Compared to Hitler</title>

<p>    In the early days of the internet, discussion boards were all the rage.  These discussions took place on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" target="_blank">Usenet</a> long before chat rooms or blogs even existed.  During this time Mike Godwin made a simple observation that people were being maliciously being compared to Hitler or the Nazis across a wide array of topics.</p>
<p>    There are some discussions that practically beg for these comparisons &#8211; for example arguments pro gun control or censorship (both supported by Hitler).  But no matter the topic, as the online discussions grew longer the participants resorted to attacking each others credibility.  From there it is a only short and eventual hop to call someone a Nazi.</p>
<p>    More generally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum" target="_blank">reductio ad Hitlerum</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Latin" target="_blank">dog Latin term</a> &#8211; made up Latin to make it sound official) extends this principle beyond the realm of the internet.  Comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis show up in all types of debates &#8211; even if you think you are in a <a href="http://www.delawareliberal.net/2010/06/03/urquhart-goes-on-godwin-overload/" target="_blank">civilized discussion</a> where such an <a href="http://gothamist.com/2009/07/21/state_senators_vs_mayor_bloomberg_s.php" target="_blank">immature comparison</a> wouldn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/21/AR2005062101753.html" target="_blank">take place</a>.</p>
<p>It was Godwin&#8217;s contention that these comparisons only serve to weaken the intended point and make the entire debate look like childish name calling.  To quote the great Jay-Z &#8211; &#8220;A wise man told me don&#8217;t argue with fools cause people from a distance can&#8217;t tell who is who.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem: if you stay in the debate forever a comparison to Hitler will eventually be made and you will look like an idiot, even if you were not the one saying it.  The takeaways: avoid YouTube comment debates at all costs, stick to areas of the internet where mostly intelligent people congregate, end the debate as soon as possible, and don&#8217;t be surprised if you still end up falling pray to Godwin&#8217;s Law of Nazi Analogies.</p>
