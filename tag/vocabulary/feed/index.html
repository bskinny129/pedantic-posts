<p>Just about every obscure item you can imagine has a proper name.  Someone before you previously attempted describing the item, discovered that &#8220;blue thingy&#8221; was not descriptive enough and took the liberty to making up a name that everyone can use.  But of course not everyone knows the official name and the item is inevitably still referred to as adjective + &#8220;thingy&#8221;.  I am not advocating adding thousands of nouns to your vocabulary in the off chance that you may one day want to refer to the flap of skin on your hand between your thumb and index finger (<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3587982459_7a00379c52.jpg" target="_blank">purlicue</a>).  But there are a few that I would like to pass on to my readers in hopes that they will be widely used one day. Try dropping these into conversations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aglet &#8211; the hard plastic part at the end of a shoelace</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn" target="_blank">Cairn</a> &#8211; a pile of stones made by hikers</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrule" target="_blank">Ferrule</a> &#8211; the metal piece at the end of the pencil that holds the eraser on</li>
<li>Muselet &#8211; the wire thing on the top of a bottle of champagne to keep the cork from flying off under the pressure</li>
<li>Zarf &#8211; the cardboard coffee sleeve you receive at Starbucks to keep you from burning yourself through the thin cup</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" title="5 words" src="http://pedanticposts.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/5-words.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="130" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photos: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9669564@N07/1433711283/" target="_blank">Tom Wefald</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Three_Different_Aglets.jpg" target="_blank">Ian W. Fieggen</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/webel/135799006/" target="_blank">Steve Webel</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/namkeng/4255222654/" target="_blank">Fredrik Thommesen</a></p>
<p>When you do in fact use one of these words in conversation, you will undoubtedly have to explain the meaning.  This is a perfect opportunity to share all five of these words, which will make you look like a genius and promote the use of adding of these words into common use!</p>
