				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The youngest person ever has finished rehab &#8211; what a great success story!  After 3 months in rehab, a two year old Indonesian boy has successfully kicked his smoking habit.  Allegedly, he began smoking at 11 months old when his father gave him a cigarette to help ease a headache.  By the time he was 2 years of age, he was smoking 2 packs a day!</p>
<p>Ok, maybe under these special circumstances, completing rehab with flying colors is not a success story. What an epic failure of parents! How can they be such morons? You parents out there that give into your babies anytime a tear is shed &#8211; I hope you are strong enough to hold out if your kid was begging for a cigarette. It&#8217;s hard to believe anyone can be the perfect combination of a pushover and ignoramus, let alone both parents!</p>
<p>If the family could continue to afford 2 packs a day and the Indonesian government hadn&#8217;t step in, I&#8217;m sure this kid would still be puffing away. But this story also delivers a great deal of hope.  Hope because we now live in a world where it is no longer a possibility to be the worst parent &#8211; unless you actively try to do worse than these two Indonesians, I am quite sure you will surpass their low bar.</p>
