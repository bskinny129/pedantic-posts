<p>In 1951 a young black woman by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" target="_blank">Henrietta Lacks</a> died of cancer.  Her cancer was unlike any seen before, or since, and has transformed modern medicine &#8211; her cells are immortal!</p>
<p>Henrietta’s miraculous cancer cells reproduce outside of the body &#8211; in a culture dish cells typically only divide a few times before they die, but hers have been alive for almost 60 years!  Scientists found the incredibly fast growth rate of her cancer grew just as fast indefinitely in a test tube.  They believed her cells held the key to curing cancer and even making humans immortal &#8211; unfortunately these have yet to happen.</p>
<p>Her cells, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa" target="_blank">HeLa cell line</a>, have been sent all over the world for testing, and even out of this world (as in outer space).  Never before was it possible to do long term tests on human cells without testing on an actual human &#8211; the cell line would die after a couple days outside of the body.  With the HeLa line this was suddenly possible.  It has been used for testing the first Polio vaccine, as well as research into cancer, AIDS, radiation effects, sensitivity to toxic substances, gene mapping, and many other medical causes.</p>
<p>Today over 20 tons of her cells exist in petri dishes scattered across the globe.  It’s amazing that after all this time, doctors still have not discovered why the HeLa cells behave unlike any others.  In the last 60 years Henrietta Lack’s cells have been instrumental in advancing modern medicine &#8211; potentially in the next 60 years they will even help find a cure for cancer.</p>

<strong>More stuff:</strong></p>

<p></p>
<li>Henrietta Lacks was a black tobacco farmer in southern Virginia who was diagnosed with cervical cancer at 30.  Without her knowledge or permission, a doctor took a sample of her cancer cells (apparently this was normal at the time).  Two decades after Henrietta&#8217;s death her family started receiving calls for blood samples to learn more about the family’s genetics.  This is the first time they heard about her miraculous cells and all the medical testing for which they have been used.  They also wondered why it had been done without consent, and how modern medicine could be advanced so much thanks to Henrietta Lacks, but her own children could not afford health insurance.</li>
<p></p>
<li>One downside to the HeLa line is that it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contaminated_cell_lines" target="_blank">contaminated numerous other cell lines</a> over the years.  Doctors were pumped when they saw other types of cells reproducing indefinitely, but it turned out the sample was just contaminated with HeLa cells.  HeLa is so resilient it takes just one cell to make its way into a petri dish for it to multiply and ruin the entire sample.</li>
<p></p>
<li>There are a few immortal cell lines that exist in animals, most notably the contagious cancers found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_transmissible_venereal_tumor" target="_blank">dogs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease" target="_blank">Tasmanian Devils</a>.</li>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chernobylbob/4135862503/" target="_blank">Matt Smith</a></p>
<p>Abortion is a hot button issue in the United States and nearly everyone has an unwavering opinion &#8211; there is no argument that can be made here that will instantly change your belief.  Instead I will share with you some eye opening statistics regarding abortion and let you draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>I am not one to wholeheartedly believe in statistics as a statistic can be dug up (or created) to support any viewpoint.  My main issue with taking statistics at face value is that there can be numerous errors in the study which are reflected in the final data.  Is it truly a random sample?  Is it a big enough sample to draw any conclusions?  Was the study funded by an organization that had an interest in the results coming out a certain way?  Fortunately, abortion is not a difficult activity to track as nearly all abortions take place in a hospital or abortion clinic.  The healthcare industry accurately tracks everything &#8211; in a 2008 sample of 100 hospitals there were 4 injuries relating to slicing zucchini, including one for trying to slice it with a mandolin &#8230;</p>
<p>In the case of abortion the margin of error is largely irrelevant &#8212; are you even able to come up with a ballpark answer?  How common are abortions?  5% of all pregnancies?  10%?  20%?  40%?  Higher?</p>
<p>In the United States 20% of all pregnancies result in an abortion.  What&#8217;s interesting is that this number varies greatly across the country and the world.  The District of Columbia and New York are close to 40% while many rural states are under 10%.</p>
<p><span id="more-70"></span><br />
The variation within the United States is large, but it is huge when you compare countries with completely different cultures.  Russia and Greenland lead the world with half of all pregnancies ending with abortion.  At the bottom of the list are Hispanic nations such as Mexico, Panama, Chile and Portugal with less than 1%.  Is it mainly religious beliefs, economics, or culture than creates such large differentials?</p>
<p>Who are the women having all these abortions in the US?  Two facts combine to skew the statistics towards older women: the abortion rate peaked around 1990 and they have been alive longer to have more sex.  An estimated 40% of all United States women in their 40s have had at least one abortion!  If you take all women who are of childbearing age or have been in the last couple decades (ages 15 to 64), almost 30% of them have had an abortion.  This is shocking when you consider a non-trivial chunk of those women are virgins (mainly the teenagers).  Without diving into the numbers too far, we can conclude that over a third of sexually active women (15 to 64) in the United States have had an abortion!</p>
<p>There are 6.7 billion people living on this planet, but what if none of these abortions took place?  There have been approximately 1 billion abortions over the past 100 years with U.S.S.R / Russia accounting for one third, China accounting for one third, and the rest of the world making up the last third!  If those pregnancies were not aborted the world population would be closer to 8 billion (some of the aborted babies would have gone on to have children of their own).  We currently don&#8217;t have a solution for overcrowding, food shortages, and pollution, but can you imagine if it was 20% worse right now?</p>
<p>These statistics are certainly eye opening whether you view abortion as an issue or a solution to an issue.</p>
<p><em>In your comments please be cognizant of the fact that many people hold strong beliefs on this topic.  This is not a forum for debate.</em></p>
