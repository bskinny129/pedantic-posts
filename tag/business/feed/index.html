<p>Here’s something may be a shock to you: when you pull up to a fast food, you might be talking someone in a call center thousands of miles away!  It turns out numerous fast food chains have been experimenting with this over the last five years.  If you are at a Wendy’s you might be talking to someone in Delaware, Jack in the Box to the Phillippines or Texas, or McDonald&#8217;s to India.</p>
<p>These companies claim the benefits are shorter wait times and less mistakes due to a further division of labor where each person can focus on one menial task.  Well, maybe they don’t say it quite like that.  It is hard to tell the extent to which this system is currently deployed in the United States &#8211; after a flurry of news stories about this experiment 4-5 years ago, the fast food companies have not informed the public how it has gone.  My suspicion is that they strategically expanded the program nationwide to select franchises, specifically ones with multiple drive thru lines or notoriously hard to understand operators.</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/extranoise/278465198/" target="_blank">Till Krech</a></p>
<p>Thousands, if not millions of Americans have lost their job overseas.  Due to the recently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Flat-History-Twenty-first-Century/dp/0374292884" target="_blank">flattened world</a>, companies are now able to find workers in remote countries eager to work longer hours for significantly less pay.</p>
<p><strong>Why do companies outsource jobs?</strong><br />
It’s simple &#8211; money.  Companies have the goal of making money, not employing the most Americans as possible.  Sometimes these conflict.  If the business can make more money by laying off unnecessary workers or outsourcing jobs overseas, we have seen time and time again that they will.</p>
<p><strong>Is this wrong?</strong><br />
No, it is not wrong.  The company is simply responding to incentives &#8211; specifically, the management of the company is responding to incentives.  The more money the company makes, the more money the executives make.  These executives are often extremely removed from the lowest paid individuals who see their jobs outsourced &#8211; the management sees the pros but not the cons.</p>
<p><strong>What is the result?</strong><br />
A report by McKinsey showed for every $1 of labor outsourced overseas, the United States receives $1.12 back (in addition to 33 cents retained by the country that does the work).  So by outsourcing we are able to boost our production 12% without actually working!</p>
<p>Overall this sounds like a win for the United States, but in reality maybe it&#8217;s not &#8211; those simple numbers do not tell the whole story.  Instead of $1 being dispersed amongst the poorest, $1.12 goes into the pockets of the richest!  Outsourcing is a very efficient way of redistributing wealth &#8211; the poor in the US lose $1, the poor outside the US gain 33 cents, while the rich in the US gain $1.12!</p>
<p><strong>Why outsourcing will not be stopped</strong><br />
Corporate executives are the ones who make the decisions for the business.  They are also the ones who benefit the most from outsourcing jobs.  If we expect outsourcing to stop, we have to change the incentives so that the negativities of outsourcing are felt.</p>
<p>Of course, the people who have the ability to change economic incentives are politicians &#8211; politicians that are buddy-buddy with the corporate big wigs and the associated lobbyists.  Thus, until outsourcing becomes a compelling issue, nothing will change.</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13511355@N06/1375685165/">wohnai</a></p>
<p>Over the last couple years an exciting new trend has emerged amongst universities across the country &#8211; they are providing courses online for free!  Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, Columbia, UCLA, and John Hopkins are just some of the schools that have lecture videos of entire courses online.</p>
<p><strong>Why the heck are these schools doing this?</strong><br />
It is the free information movement.  Just like there was a free love movement in the 1970&#8217;s, there is a similar free knowledge movement in the early part of the new century.  Wikipedia is the epitome &#8211; its free information has become a part of the way we research just about everything.  Another manifestation of this is the huge open source software movement providing free software to the masses.  Examples are the Linux operating system, Mozilla Firefox web browser, and Android phone operating system.  It is a cultural and economic phenomenon that deserves much more attention than a few sentences, but there is not room in this post so I will refrain &#8211; just be sure to take advantage of it!</p>
<p><strong>What exactly are they offering?</strong><br />
It varies widely from school to school and even class to class.  The organization OpenCourseWare currently has 200 schools with 13,000 courses offered online &#8211; some just have the lecture videos, while others also have the assignments and exams complete with solutions.  Beyond what is posted you are on your own &#8211; there are no help resources such as teacher assistants or other class members to contact.</p>
<p><span id="more-376"></span><br />
<strong>What&#8217;s the catch?</strong><br />
Unfortunately just because these schools offer their course material for free, it does not mean you are able to receive a college diploma for free.  In fact, even if you watch all the lectures and complete all the assignments you will not receive any recognition whatsoever.  No diploma, no credits, no nothing.  All you get is the knowledge!  Sadly, getting a degree today isn&#8217;t so much about gaining knowledge as it is gaining the recognition for that knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>There has to be a way to receive credit</strong><br />
Well, there are a few different tests that can grant you college credits: AP, CLEP, and DSST.  The only problem is there are an extremely limited number of tests for college credit, meaning the vast majority of the 13,000 courses online do not have a corresponding test.  There are 30 AP tests ($86 each) accepted at 3,600 colleges, 33 CLEP tests ($77 each) accepted at 2,900 colleges, and 38 DSST tests ($80 each) accepted at 2,000 colleges.  You have to see if the college you attend (or are planning to attend) will accept the specific test, what their score requirements are, and any other nuances.</p>
<p>These tests also do not closely match the depth of courses offered online for free.  The AP, CLEP, and DSST tests are all for somewhat elementary subjects &#8211; courses that would fit your general education requirement in college and help you achieve the minimum number of credits needed to graduate, but nothing beyond that.  There definitely are not any AP tests that correspond to MIT courses &#8220;Principals of Digital Communications I&#8221; or &#8220;Control of the Manufacturing Process&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Well why not?</strong><br />
That is a great questions.  Obviously completing &#8220;Principals of Digital Communications I&#8221;, a graduate level MIT course, is more impressive than passing the AP Psychology exam.  It seems there are just too many distinctive courses offered to provide college credit tests for each.  Also, each university then has to decide which tests it will accept for credit and the minimum score required.  It is not an easy task.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t it an important task?</strong><br />
Yes, I believe it is important.  People need the motivation to go out and take these free online courses.  The student needs support when the going gets tough, and also recognition upon completion in the form of course credits.  The benefits of this movement could be huge &#8211; it has the potential to lower the cost of a college degree massively by paying $80 for a test rather than taking a $1200 course.  This could make college attainable for millions of individuals with internet access who currently do not have the money for college.  When the students do arrive at college in person, they will be ready for more advanced studies, hopefully leading to more graduate degrees.  </p>
<p><strong>Who is responsible for making this happen?</strong><br />
It is clear the government would see a benefit by both helping to relieve congestion at our overcrowded universities and a better educated populace.  However, a government solution would not be dynamic enough to adapt to the ever changing selection of courses offered for free online.  A government test could potentially be too easy as the AP, CLEP, and DSST test currently are &#8211; this forces each individual university to decide which tests they will accept, and the minimum score required.</p>
<p>The colleges themselves could create their own tests for passing out of a course and receiving credit.  For example, MIT could develop tests for the numerous online courses they offer.  This way MIT is assured the quality of the course as well as setting their own standards for difficulty.  The downfall is that this would result in reinventing the wheel numerous times with different standards for each college.</p>
<p>I believe the real solution must come from the private sector.  A company could work closely with the top universities to develop formidable tests across a wide array of advanced subjects.  If the best schools in the country agree to accept the results of the test for credit, the state schools with less stringent requirements should have no issue.  A private business would also be dynamic enough to adjust to the ever changing selection of learning material online and determine which ones closely match courses offered at schools across the country.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t particularly easy, but could be the easiest improvement we can make to our post high school eduction system.  Who is with me?  What other ideas or difficulties might there be around this idea?</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daviddmuir/2125697998/" target="_blank">David D. Muir</a></p>
<p>Most people think the benefit of attending a top tier school is the ability to nab a high paying job &#8211; investment banking, consulting, CEO, etc.  Sure those opportunities are great, but I am going to argue that the real advantage is the ability to pursue work that the individual finds interesting.  Right now you are probably thinking &#8211; can&#8217;t anyone do that?  Yes, but a top tier degree enables you to do it without worrying about money &#8211; you have a great degree to fall back on if things don&#8217;t work out.  It&#8217;s not the maximum salary opportunities that matter, but rather the high minimum salary that can be expected with a degree from an elite university.</p>
<p>The focus of students at these schools is not merely passing versus failing &#8211; all the students admitted to top tier schools are capable of doing the work, in fact thousands of capable students are rejected every year.  Keeping this in mind, these students are going to have a focus other than passing and failing: grades, social life, sports, clubs, job, girls, etc.  I won&#8217;t go into what their focus should be in the post, only what they should do in the meantime &#8211; get a technical degree!  Not all college diplomas are equal, even if they do come from the same school.  Graduating with a technical degree will prove valuable later when it comes to your career.</p>
<p>Many college students make the mistake of choosing a major because it is easy and they will be able to get a higher GPA while working less.  A technical major is much more important for job demand than GPA.  In fact, leave GPA out of the consideration &#8211; after your first job, who cares?  The answer is graduate schools, but that is not a job.  Who is going to have a harder time quickly finding a job, someone with a aerospace engineering degree and a 3.1 GPA or someone with a classics degree and a 3.4 GPA?  These majors may be harder but it is well worth a sacrifice of a couple tenths off your GPA in exchange for job demand.</p>
<p><span id="more-72"></span><br />
A good major from a top school sets the minimum you can expect to make very high.  An engineer from Stanford will almost always be able to find a job with a sixty thousand dollar salary (keep in mind these are rough estimates).  Can you say the same about the classics major?  The classics major will likely have the same ability to land an eighty thousand dollar consulting job, but if that doesn&#8217;t work there isn&#8217;t an obvious fall back option.  Without some connections and a good amount of luck this individual may land down closer to the Stanford degree &#8220;minimum&#8221; forty thousand.  The same principle applies to degrees from the lowest ranked colleges as well, although the numbers would all be knocked down significantly.  A non-technical degree from one of these schools does not come with any job guarantees significantly above a high school education.</p>
<p>Running with this idea, I&#8217;d like to share my definition of job security.  It is not the security that you feel with regards to your current employment, but the ability to find a similar salary if you are suddenly forced to switch companies.  There will likely be several instances throughout your lifetime where you will be forced to unexpectedly find a new job &#8212; layoffs, bankruptcy, moving to a new city, or just plain fired.  No matter how big a control freak you are there are some situations that are completely out of your control.  In these emergency situations it is important to be able to expect a high minimum salary.</p>
<p>With this new definition of job security comes the ability to pursue something that you are interested in.  Unless your personal minimum salary bar is set high enough to support your lifestyle, it may not be prudent to switch jobs.  For example, a psychology major from Montana State has a job making good money that he hates.  This individual is not very likely to quit in search of a job that interests him because if it doesn&#8217;t work out he is screwed.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s examine a MIT graduate with a technical degree.  She is in a similar situation &#8211; hates her job but is making good money.  The difference is that she is in a position to switch jobs in search of something that interests her or even start her own company.  If this individual spends 6 months trying to start her own company which massively fails, she can easily go back to a job in her prior field and be able to support her lifestyle. All that she has to risk is 6 months of her time, but she has the peace of mind that after 6 months she can return to an equally payed, equally despised job.  As a result, graduates from top tier universities are much more likely to find work they are passionate about or strike it rich by starting their own company.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you have to be passionate about your technical degree, or that getting a tech degree should be <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/your-college-is-not-a-technical-school/" target="_blank">your reason for going to college</a>.  If you know your passion is 18th century French poetry then by all means you should major in it. But if you are like most college entrants and have yet to discover your passion, take the conservative approach in college by getting a technical degree &#8211; it will free you up to take risks later in your career.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/4018855041/" target="_blank">Wally Gobetz</a></p>
<p>Yesterday I explained the pitfalls of <a href="http://pedanticposts.com/too-much-venture-funding/" target="_blank">too much venture funding</a>.  Whenever posting about a problem I will always attempt to follow up the next day with a potential solution.  My idea is a Venture Capital funded bank account to be used by the startup where every X dollars spent translates into a percentage point of equity.  The beauty in this model is that the startup receives the funding they need, but are incentivized to keeps their costs under control and become profitable in a hurry.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a fictitious hot new internet startup looking for series B funding to take them to the next level.  The offer they receive from KPCB is $10 million in exchange for a 40% in the company.  Sounds great right: a ton of money from one of the best venture firms at what the founders feel is a generous valuation.  Wrong!  Take that same valuation but avoid the trap of taking more money than you need.  Here is a potential counter offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2 million immediately for an 8% stake
<ul>
<li>This amount will certainly be needed before becoming profitable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The VC firm opens a bank account / line of credit for up to $8 million more where every $25k is 0.1% of equity
<ul>
<li>Forces the startup to watch their expenses rather than quickly burning through money without consequences</li>
<li>Protects startup from equity dilution (<a href="http://www.gaebler.com/How-Equity-Dilution-Works.htm" target="_blank">an excellent explanation</a>) by only granting equity to the VC for funding used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If things start to go downhill for the startup there must be some protection from the VCs simply closing the account.  Here are some potential rules:<br />
<span id="more-28"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Account must be open for a minimum 2 years or when all $8 million is spent.
<ul>
<li>In the event that the VC wishes to close the account after two years they are responsible for 3 months at the current burn rate (the monthly rate they are losing money: expenses &#8211; income).</li>
<li>Here is an example.  At the end of the two years the VC firm notifies the startup that they wish to cut funding.  The startup has spent 5 of the original 8 million and their current monthly burn rate is $200k.  With this rule the VC firm must leave $600k (3 months multiplied by $200k a month) in the account to get the startup through the next 3 months while they search for additional financing, miraculously reach profitability, or prepare for their grave.  The good news is that the VC fund lost $2.4 million less than they would have with their initial offer ($2 million immediately + $5 million for the first two years + $600k for the final three months)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If things go well for the startup the VCs must be protected against outside investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>No additional funding to the startup is allowed unless all $8 million is exchanged for equity
<ul>
<li>1 year in if the valuation of the startup skyrocketed this would prevent them from taking funding at the new valuation that has much better terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This deal should be attractive to VCs because they originally wanted to invest at the given valuation, although they are only getting a smaller portion of guaranteed equity.  An extra benefit is that if things do go well they get to continually invest at the old valuation &#8211; a year later if the valuation of the startup is $100 million they still get to invest at the original $22 million valuation.  This certainly sounds attractive.</p>
<p>But this idea could be made even more complicated.  Why have a linear relation between the funding taken and equity provided?  As the 2 year deadline draws near it should be much more &#8220;expensive&#8221; for the startup to burn through funding (because they should be profitable at this point and if they aren&#8217;t it is highly risky) &#8211; potentially $10k for 0.1%.  A function for the change in payout vs. time could be negotiated.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Venture Capital firms would go for this model but it is worth a try.  I know if I ever find myself in the position with a VC offer I will counter with this complex scheme.</p>

<p>One pitfall for startups is taking on more funding than they need in exchange for a huge chunk of the company.  It is obvious that the reverse is a problem &#8212; not enough funding means the young company has to be instantly profitable and will not be able to rapidly bring in new talent.  Not as apparent but almost as dangerous is taking too much funding.</p>
<p>The examples are endless in the dot com boom.  Webvan, Kozmo, RealNames, eStyle, Upromise, Priceline WebHouse Club, 800.com, Autolines, and Pets.com are some companies that had north of $100 million in funding and went out of business.  After that debacle venture capitalists are more weary to hand out that kind of money.  Only a handful such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Zenga have crossed a $100 mil.  A further sign of caution is that in these latest examples the money often came well after the company had proven themselves with millions of users or by already being profitable.</p>
<p>Despite the regression in funding since the dot com bust, there still is too much money flying around for internet startups.  Websites that are a good idea but lack a monitization strategy can raise tens of millions of dollars with good connections and a little luck.  These aren&#8217;t large-scale manufacturing companies that need to purchase machinery or brick and mortar stores that need to purchase expensive inventory, they are websites that only need to buy a few servers.  They have no need for tens of millions.</p>
<p>What happens when a startup receives more funding than they need?</p>
<ul>
<li>It removes the sense of urgency to become profitable.</li>
<li>It makes it appear like the funding is a win, when really it is just a step in the process to having a profitable company, not the end goal.</li>
<li>The founders may become paper millionaires and lose focus.</li>
<li>The company loses control in the form of pressure from a VC firm with a huge vested interest.</li>
<li>The company owns less by selling equity for money they don&#8217;t need.</li>
<li>They spend the money foolishly because they can.  There were famous dot com heyday parties that cost over a quarter million.</li>
<li>They blow money on marketing.  Obviously marketing is important, but cash strapped companies are forced to be creative with their marketing and still get more results than a Pets.com Super Bowl commercial.</li>
<li>Overaggressive expansion.  Expanding before having a plan leads to unnecessary employees without direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we all agree that too much venture funding is a bad thing, what can we do about it?  Check back tomorrow for my idea.</p>

<p style="font-size: 8pt;">Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amagill/3367543094/" target="_blank">Andrew Magill</a></p>
<p>I receive a monthly paycheck.  No I&#8217;m not bragging, quite the opposite, I am complaining.  This sounds great to those who are unemployed, but why do I have to wait an entire month before being payed?  The work that I do on March 1st I will not actually receive any compensation for until April 1st, 31 days later.  To put it another way, 0.1% of my life later.  Now does it seem like a bigger deal?  I would much rather have the instant gratification of immediately receiving the wages of my hard day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Before big corporations came about I imagine everyone got paid at the end of the day.  Today we sign agreements to give the company the right to only pay us once a week, bi-weekly, or even monthly regardless of whether you are paid by the hour or on salary.  And of course there is no interest paid even though they are holding what is rightfully your money.  My solution I call continuous direct deposit.</p>
<p>In the workplace money is never physically handed to the employee by their boss, it is all done by either check or direct deposit.  Direct deposit allows for the transferring of funds from one bank account to another without dealing with cash or checks.  Continuous direct deposit would transfer money from the employer&#8217;s bank account to the employee&#8217;s at infinitesimally short time periods &#8212; time periods that would make my monthly paycheck look like an eternity.  Anyone with a salaried position can determine how much money they make any given minute, second, or even millisecond.  This can be boiled down into an equation to be used to continuously deposit your paycheck into your account.</p>
<p>In theory you should be able to head to your bank&#8217;s website, repetitiously hit refresh, and watch you balance slowly tick up.  Altering the equation could ensure that money is only deposited weekdays or during work hours.</p>
<p><span id="more-16"></span><br />
My employer has almost entirely salaried positions and nearly everyone is signed up for direct deposit &#8211; I know because the pile of checks handed out once a month is very small.  The company is in stable financial condition such that it does not need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_30" target="_blank">Net 30</a> terms to pay each employee &#8211; there is a large enough store of cash such that even if no income was generated that month it would still be able to pay the employees.  Thus, my company should strive to pay the employees as quickly as possible for the work they have already completed.</p>
<p>There are some hurdles that would have to be overcome to make continuous direct deposit a reality.  The first is figuring out what to do about the tax withholdings, IRA contributions, health care deductions, etc. that automatically come out of each paycheck.  This obstacle can be conquered: simply do the same continuous direct deposit into each of the accounts.  If it is not possible, the bank could still do it on a monthly basis for certain accounts and continuous for others.  Pay stubs are another issue &#8211; will continuous deposits result in infinite pay stubs being created?  No, I do not even think you would have to indicate that the money was being continuously deposited and can still create the pay stubs on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>The final and ultimate hurdle is ability of the banking system to support transfers on the order of seconds if not milliseconds.  Unfortunately there is no indication that this will be attainable in the near future.  The idea of continuously compounding interest around nearly forever, technology has made it possible in the last couple decades, yet it costs banks more money so they will not offer it.  Banks will not benefit from continuous direct deposit so they are not likely to offer it any time soon.   The only possibility for making this dream a reality is that more and more people demand it, especially huge companies that hold large sums of money.</p>
