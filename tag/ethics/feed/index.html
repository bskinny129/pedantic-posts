<p>I love attaining knowledge, but here is a puzzling question &#8211; is it ethical to use information gained in an unethical way?  If so, are we just supposed to turn a blind eye to how it was obtained and move on?  If not, are we just supposed to forget the knowledge we gained and pretend it never happened?  Neither option jumps out as the right answer, so let&#8217;s inspect a couple examples.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Information</strong><br />
How about an extreme example &#8211; let&#8217;s take a look at the Nazis, some of the least ethical people ever.  They did a whole series of messed up experiments on human prisoners that resulted in thousands of deaths and countless more ended with dismemberment, disability, or at the very least emotional torment.  Just to give you an idea, some of the tests were carried out to find out the the effects on the human body of extreme cold and heat, mustard gas and other poisons, altitude, and drinking salt water.</p>
<p>Today we know a lot about the limits of the human body because the Nazis forced thousands of people past the limit and did not stop until they were dead.  For example, we now know that you die from hypothermia when your body temperature reaches approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  Researchers today openly use the Nazi experiment data and are determined to see good come from all the deaths by using it to help others in the future.  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/naziexp.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good essay examining the ethical debate of using this data.</p>
<p><span id="more-200"></span><br />
<strong>Forgetting the Information</strong><br />
The official stance of the United States judicial system is to forget the information.  Of course you can&#8217;t tell someone to forget something and actually expect them to do it, but you can keep it from being used in court.  The most well known example of this is the Fourth Amendment prohibition of illegal search and seizure.  If the police don&#8217;t have the proper warrants to search for evidence or do not alert you of your rights, whatever evidence they find cannot be used against you in court.  It&#8217;s like it never happened.  This of course discourages illegal searches from happening in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>You Decide</strong><br />
It is up to you whether you try to create good from the bad by using the unethical information or rather throw it out so as to not promote the wrong behavior.  Win-Lose or Lose-Win.</p>

<p>Regardless of your religious beliefs, you have to admit the Bible is huge, hard to read, and contains some ridiculous stories with outdated ideologies &#8212; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022&amp;version=NASB" target="_blank">talking donkeys</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">people turning into pillars of salt</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:34-36&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">sexism</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+13&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">stoning other religions</a> &#8230;  whether you believe those stories wholeheartedly or dismiss them as parables from which we are to learn is up to you.  Unfortunately all the aforementioned shortcomings have resulted in most people, even those you would describe as religious, never picking up the Bible to read it all the way through.  This is unfortunate not in a religious sense, but because it is the only account of the life of Jesus, one of the best role models of all time.  How are supposed to learn about this man?  Which parts of the Bible are actually important and not outdated or unbelievable?  How are we to know which passages to skip over?  Luckily Thomas Jefferson took care of this for us.</p>
<p><strong>The third president of the United States?</strong><br />
The same.  Jefferson created what we now call <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jefferson-Bible-Morals-Nazareth-Little/dp/1557091846" target="_blank">&#8220;The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&#8221;</a> by thoroughly reading the Bible and cutting out the passages he deemed important to paste in his shortened version of the bible.  What were his criteria?  Mainly it was based upon the passage&#8217;s demonstration of Jesus&#8217;s teachings and authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>He didn&#8217;t believe the Bible was authentic?</strong><br />
Nope.  Jefferson was a deist who believed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists" target="_blank">four evangelists</a> were grossly unqualified to write the account of the life of Jesus.  He thought the authors made up or greatly exaggerated numerous elements including the virgin birth, walking on water, rising from the dead, and being the son of God.  Despite the perceived fallacies Thomas Jefferson realized the importance of learning from the core teachings of this great man.</p>
<p><span id="more-76"></span><br />
<strong>What is deism?</strong><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism" target="_blank">Deism</a> is based upon the belief that you only need rational thought, not faith, to understand God.  They believe that God put the universe into motion and then left it alone &#8211; which means God did not send he own son to earth to meddle.  Deists highly regard morality, in fact placing it above everything else.  It is for this reason that the life of Jesus was so intriguing to Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p><strong>What did he come up with?</strong><br />
Jefferson&#8217;s new Bible contains about 1000 verses which is only one-eighth of the New Testament.  It was not something Jefferson ever shared with the general public because he knew his reputation would take a hit in such a religious time.  Long after his death congress published the Jefferson Bible and it is now in the public domain, providing anyone and everyone the opportunity to read it for free online (see links below).</p>
<p><strong>So why did he do it?</strong><br />
For himself.  Jefferson wanted to assemble the best code of morals from which he could learn.  He only shared it with close friends because he knew it was a radical idea that would not go over well with his intensely religious countrymen.   Thomas Jefferson simply admired Jesus as a great philosopher and the best example of morality.  Even though he disagreed with Christianity on so many fronts, Jefferson realized the core teachings are extremely valuable &#8211; the core values should not be thrown out because part of the religious beliefs are irrational.</p>
