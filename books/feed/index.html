		<description><![CDATA[It was good - I definitely learned a ton. I really didn&#039;t know much about cancer, especially the history of it before the book. Some of the specifics might be more appreciated by you due to your bio background (most of it went over my head), but there were also some cancer patient stories to real me back in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a good book. I didn&#039;t even know Ariely had another book, it&#039;s now added to my list as well.

I&#039;ll work on the thoughts about each book. Maybe an enjoyment/recommendation rating as well. Let me know what types of non-fiction you are interested in and I&#039;ll probably have a recommendation.

I read non-fiction because I enjoy it! I don&#039;t think it is a phase - I sprinkle in a few fiction books here and there, but I enjoy learning about real things. If it is a story I&#039;m reading, I&#039;d prefer to know that it actually happened rather than made up.

		<description><![CDATA[What did you think of Predictably Irrational? Have you read Ariely&#039;s other book? He&#039;s on my list of books to get to. His TED talks are really interesting.

I think it would be cool to see a couple sentences of final thoughts for each book. How am I supposed to know what book to read next!?

Why are you predominately reading nonfiction? Is that more of a phase or has that been a common theme for your reading habits for a while?]]></description>
