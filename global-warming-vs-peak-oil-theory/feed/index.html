		<description><![CDATA[The worrisome parts are the follow-on effects to atmospheric/oceanic warming. Human-liberated hydrocarbons are just one element... people have been harping on deforestation as another vicious cycle component for decades (fortunately, we&#039;ve done a decent job of managing our forests in North America, anyway...) 

What happens if slight temperature effects shift system dynamics... oceanic flow pattern shifts, the unlocking of &quot;frozen&quot; methane hydrates in the arctic seabed... all of these outcomes are terrifying.

But it remains to be seen whether they are credible. 

Peak oil theory seems to be bearing out, but doesn&#039;t in any way counteract the potential environmental catastrophes we could face in the near future. And the other huge problem is, no &quot;alternative energy solutions&quot; are that easy to find. It turns out it&#039;s pretty hard to make electrons and make big metal things move. It&#039;s either hard on the environment because things are too damn efficient at exploding into energy, or it&#039;s hard on our wallets because things aren&#039;t efficient enough, or both. 

I&#039;m going to go drink a beer.]]></description>
