		<description><![CDATA[Glad I found this little gem. I&#039;d be interested in talking to you more about this.. not so you have to defend, but rather enlighten. I understand why you wouldn&#039;t want to get into those deep, intimate conversations with someone you don&#039;t know, but it&#039;s kind of fun sometimes! I really enjoy your blog.. and TED is such an amazing site!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok, so this may not be a reason to not EAT meat, but it is certainly another example of the health implications of the livestock industry

maybe i&#039;m just extra sensitive to it because of those yellow gowns and purple gloves in the hospital, but it makes me want to stop eating meat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My girlfriend is vegetarian and gets asked &quot;why are you vegetarian?&quot; all the time.  It definitely gets old.   On the flip side, I don&#039;t get asked very often why I eat meat.

However, when we are asked those questions, only one of us has a defensible answer because only one of us is actually making a responsible choice. 

Whatever the reason you chose to be a vegetarian is a good one.  Whatever reason one chooses to eat meat is unclear...

So, although the question is tiresome, at least you can answer it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel conversations where I am defending my choices are incredibly intimate - I only want to have them with my closest friends.  I should have qualified that statement: I don&#039;t enjoy conversations with most people where I am defending my choices.  They also take a certain amount of time and are not appropriate for some environments.  Thus, there are other reasons I will deflect the conversation even around my best friends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I don’t enjoy conversations where I feel I am defending my choices&quot;... Really?  I feel like those are the most interesting conversations you can have with people.  I see those discussions as a very accurate reflection of who a person is - whether they have any sort of rationale behind something they are passionate about or they are just following blindly.  Why does the iPad totally suck?  Why do you believe in God?  Why would anyone buy a moped?]]></description>
