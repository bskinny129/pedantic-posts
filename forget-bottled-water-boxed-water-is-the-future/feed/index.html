		<description><![CDATA[good idea.  i think that it would be great to have this in sf. it does seem a more sustainable alternative to bottled water but here are some thoughts on any type of water sold in a container:

-do some research on what the source of the water is first. the bottled water industry (and presumably the boxed water industry) is not as strictly regulated as the drinking water coming out of your tap.

-when you buy water our by the bottle (or box) vs. the tap you are paying SIGNIFICANTLY more per fluid oz.

-SF drinking water is some of the BEST IN THE COUNTRY!  seriously, you should all be drinking out of camelbak water bottles (albeit your water does come from the hetch hetchy ; another can of worms completely)

-our lives are designed for bottle and cup shaped things (e.g. cup holders in cars). that is part of what makes water bottles attractive, their mobility. they lose part of their utility as you move toward a box b/c of shape difference.

just some things to think about]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Boxed Water is an incredible idea, but it will probably be abused just like everything else in a consumerist society. I think the only real solution is to realize how much we&#039;re consuming (or more importantly wasting through consumption), and change that. Granted boxes are far more sustainable than plastic, the only real solution is to carry a water bottle more often. 

Really this is connected to any pre-packaged food - fast-food, grocery stores - it&#039;s quite hard to avoid packaging.

It&#039;s a great idea, i mean we all get caught up in the hustle and bustle!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well trees are more sustainable than plastic, because who even knows where plastic comes from. Trees grow out of the ground and can be used sustainably - plant as many as you cut down! But it usually doesn&#039;t work that way. Can we plant as many plastic trees as we use for our bottles of water? Prolly not ...

Negative impact? Potentially (and usually in practice). But better.]]></description>
