		<description><![CDATA[What about the opposite of &quot;cellar door,&quot; either words that don&#039;t sound good together or a perfect object described by ugly words?

For instance, some people have taken to adding &quot;butt&quot; to other words for emphasis- butt hot, butt ugly, butt crack of dawn, etc.  Adding &quot;butt&quot; does seem to degrade any word or phrase.  But does it work with butt flower or butt sunset?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to free your mind, Lindberg. But I can only show you the door. You&#039;re the one that has to walk through it. 

Try turning off your part of the brain that thinks of the meaning of the word - I&#039;d suggest drugs or one of those brain surgeries where they poke your brain while you&#039;re awake and see how it affects you. But if that doesn&#039;t work, yes, words that are fun to say count too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how some words sound better than other words. &quot;Cellar door&quot; doesn&#039;t sound special at all to me. I think words are inescapably connected to their meaning making cellar door pretty boring. Some words are fun to say though. Does that count?]]></description>
