		<description><![CDATA[You are a thinker too! No posts on Valley Snippets since August 2nd, what gives?

There are no lists or turns for guest posts. Some folks are working through the idea stage, but let me know if there is a topic you would be interested in and I&#039;ll prod you along!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;People ask “Brian, you strive for efficiency everywhere else in your life, why waste so much time on Pedantic Posts?”&#039;... Who asks that?

I&#039;m excited for when I get an email blast about Pedantic Posts, but probably more excited for Buckshot tonight!]]></description>
