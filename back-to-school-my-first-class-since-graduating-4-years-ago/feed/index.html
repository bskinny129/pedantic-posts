		<description><![CDATA[No doubt the man is flawed, but a flawed man is nothing to write home about. And almost everyone has created their own success is some form of egomaniac, otherwise they would be fine on the standard path everyone takes. I&#039;m curious where you see his need for constant reminders of how great he is? I&#039;d posit that he needs people to tell him how crazy his ideas are so that he can feel like enough of a contrarian.

He is definitely elitist and extremely competitive - I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d personally knock him for those either. It does appear that his recent investment philosophy is in technology that will change the world for the better rather than just making a buck (globalization). But while not selfish, it&#039;s not necessarily selfless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My one issue with him - well, two, related, is that (1) he seems like an egomaniac who actually needs constant reminders of how great he is because of his success, and (2) he seems elitist and happy to say &quot;I only win if you lose and I&#039;m going to win&quot;]]></description>

Or his Ted Talk?

I think he is just the coolest guy-- so smart, well spoken, innovative, logical yet philosophical, seemingly humble and approachable. I am so excited for you-- enjoy your class!]]></description>
