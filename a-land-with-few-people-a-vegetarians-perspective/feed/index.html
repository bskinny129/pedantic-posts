		<description><![CDATA[I know this article refers specifically to the cattle population in NZ, but what about the sheep? 

With the sheep to human ratio being 10:1 (http://population.govt.nz/myth-busters/myth-8.aspx) I imagine that some of those creatures can be found in some tightly packed spaces. Did you see anything that might have looked like sheep-schwitz? 

I agree with Lara on that quote about committing 100%. I have so many good intentions ruined by my lack of total commitment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait a minute, wait a minute...I&#039;m pretty sure we&#039;ve had that &quot;So why are you a vegetarian?&quot; conversation before and your reasons had more to do with the environment and less to do with the deplorable living conditions of American farm animals..no?  Regardless, I&#039;m always happy to hear when other vegetarians are &quot;doin&#039; it for the animals.&quot; 

And yes, that spot on the 5 is very cow-schwitz.  Excellent pun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cow-scwhitz is brilliant!  I laughed hard when I read it (and groaned with disgust at the immediate smell recollection it triggered!)  Nicely done, Jonah.

Interesting post Brian.  I like the 100% quote and can see areas in my life where 99% (or more like 80%) results in unnecessary struggle and noise.]]></description>
